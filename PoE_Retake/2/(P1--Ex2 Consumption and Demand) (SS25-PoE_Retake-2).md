Let’s tackle this step-by-step with clarity and precision, addressing each part of the problem concisely while ensuring all necessary details are included. The individual has 24 hours to allocate between labor (L) and free time (F), earns a wage of w = 25 per hour of labor, and spends all earned income on a consumption good (q) with price p = 1, unless modified by taxes or subsidies.

### **(a) Budget Restriction and Budget Line**

The individual’s total time is constrained by:

$$Z = L + F = 24$$

where $L \geq 0$ is labor hours and $F \geq 0$ is free time. The individual earns $w = 25$ per hour of labor, so total earned income is $wL = 25L$. This income is spent entirely on the consumption good $q$, with price $p = 1$, so expenditure is $p \cdot q = 1 \cdot q = q$. The budget constraint is:

$$q = wL = 25L$$

Since $L = Z - F = 24 - F$, substitute $L$ in terms of $F$:

$$q = w(24 - F) = 25(24 - F) = 600 - 25F$$

The **budget restriction** with respect to potential income $wZ$:

- Potential income is the income if all time is spent on labor ($F = 0, L = Z$):

$$wZ = 25 \cdot 24 = 600$$



- Thus, the budget constraint can be expressed as:

$$q = w(Z - F) = 25(24 - F)$$

In terms of potential income:

$$q = wZ - wF = 600 - 25F$$

**Budget Line Diagram**:

- **Axes**: Horizontal axis is free time $F$, vertical axis is consumption $q$.
- **Intercepts**:
  - When $F = 0$, $L = 24$, so $q = 25 \cdot 24 = 600$. Point: (0, 600).
  - When $F = 24$, $L = 0$, so $q = 25 \cdot 0 = 0$. Point: (24, 0).
- **Slope**: From $q = 600 - 25F$, the slope is $\frac{\Delta q}{\Delta F} = -25$, reflecting the opportunity cost of free time (1 hour of free time costs 25 units of consumption since $w = 25$).
- The budget line is a straight line connecting (0, 600) to (24, 0).

### **(b) Changes to the Budget Line**

#### **(i) Income Tax Reduces Wage to (1 − t)w = 20**

An income tax reduces the effective wage to $(1 - t)w = 20$, so $w_{\text{net}} = 20$. The budget constraint becomes:

$$q = w_{\text{net}} L = 20L$$

Substitute $L = 24 - F$:

$$q = 20(24 - F) = 480 - 20F$$

**Budget Line Changes**:

- **Intercepts**:
  - When $F = 0$, $q = 20 \cdot 24 = 480$. Point: (0, 480).
  - When $F = 24$, $q = 20 \cdot 0 = 0$. Point: (24, 0).
- **Slope**: $\frac{\Delta q}{\Delta F} = -20$, flatter than the original slope (-25) because the after-tax wage is lower, reducing the opportunity cost of free time.
- The new budget line connects (0, 480) to (24, 0), lying **below** the original line for $F < 24$, reflecting a reduced maximum consumption due to the lower effective wage.

#### **(ii) Consumption Tax Raises Price to (1 + τ)p = 1.25**

A consumption tax increases the price of the consumption good to $(1 + \tau)p = 1.25$, so $p_{\text{net}} = 1.25$. The original wage remains $w = 25$, so income is still $wL = 25L$. The budget constraint is:

$$p_{\text{net}} \cdot q = wL$$

$$1.25q = 25L$$

$$q = \frac{25L}{1.25} = 20L$$

Substitute $L = 24 - F$:

$$q = 20(24 - F) = 480 - 20F$$

**Budget Line Changes**:

- **Intercepts**:
  - When $F = 0$, $q = 20 \cdot 24 = 480$. Point: (0, 480).
  - When $F = 24$, $q = 20 \cdot 0 = 0$. Point: (24, 0).
- **Slope**: $\frac{\Delta q}{\Delta F} = -20$, same as the income tax case, because the consumption tax effectively reduces the purchasing power of income.
- The new budget line is identical to the income tax case, connecting (0, 480) to (24, 0). It lies **below** the original line for $F < 24$.

**Note**: The income tax and consumption tax have equivalent effects on the budget line here because both reduce the real purchasing power by the same factor (from slope -25 to -20).

#### **(iii) Subsidy for Earned Income Below wL < 200**

A social transfer subsidizes earned income below $wL = 200$, given by:

$$S = 200 - wL \quad \text{for} \quad wL < 200$$

Since $w = 25$, the threshold is:

$$wL = 25L < 200 \implies L < \frac{200}{25} = 8$$

So, the subsidy applies when $L < 8$ (or equivalently, $F > 24 - 8 = 16$). Total income is earned income plus the subsidy (when applicable), and this is spent on consumption at $p = 1$:

$$q = wL + S \quad \text{(if } S > 0\text{)}$$

$$q = wL \quad \text{(if } S = 0\text{)}$$

- **For $L < 8$ ($F > 16$)**:

$$S = 200 - wL = 200 - 25L$$

$$q = wL + S = 25L + (200 - 25L) = 200$$

So, consumption is constant:

$$q = 200$$

- **For $L \geq 8$ ($F \leq 16$)**:

$$wL \geq 200 \implies S = 0$$

$$q = wL = 25L = 25(24 - F) = 600 - 25F$$

**Budget Line Changes**:

The budget line is **kinked** due to the subsidy:

- **For $F > 16$ ($L < 8$)**:
  - $q = 200$, so the budget line is **horizontal** at $q = 200$ from $F = 16$ to $F = 24$.
  - At $F = 24$, $L = 0$, $wL = 0$, $S = 200 - 0 = 200$, so $q = 200$. Point: (24, 200).
  - At $F = 16$, $L = 24 - 16 = 8$, $wL = 25 \cdot 8 = 200$, $S = 200 - 200 = 0$, but $q = wL + S = 200$. Point: (16, 200).

- **For $F \leq 16$ ($L \geq 8$)**:
  - $q = 600 - 25F$, as in the original case without subsidy.
  - At $F = 16$, $q = 200$ (as above).
  - At $F = 0$, $q = 600 - 25 \cdot 0 = 600$. Point: (0, 600).

- **Shape**: The budget line has:
  - A horizontal segment at $q = 200$ from $F = 16$ to $F = 24$.
  - A downward-sloping segment with slope $-25$ from $F = 16$ (16, 200) to $F = 0$ (0, 600).
- The kink occurs at $F = 16, q = 200$. The subsidy **raises** the budget line for $F > 16$, ensuring at least 200 units of consumption, but the original line applies for $F \leq 16$.

### **Summary of Budget Line Changes**

- **Original**: Straight line from (0, 600) to (24, 0), slope $-25$.
- **Income Tax**: Straight line from (0, 480) to (24, 0), slope $-20$, below original.
- **Consumption Tax**: Identical to income tax, (0, 480) to (24, 0), slope $-20$.
- **Subsidy**: Kinked line:
  - Horizontal at $q = 200$ from $F = 16$ to $F = 24$.
  - Slopes from (16, 200) to (0, 600) with slope $-25$.

Each change reflects how taxes or subsidies alter the trade-off between free time and consumption. If you’d like a visual representation or further clarification, let me know!
