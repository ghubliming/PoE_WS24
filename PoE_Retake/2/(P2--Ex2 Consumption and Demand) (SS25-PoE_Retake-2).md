To determine whether the four assumptions on preferences—completeness, transitivity, monotonicity, and convexity—can hold together given the provided information about an individual's preferences for apples and oranges, let’s analyze each assumption in the context of the stated preferences:

1. **Given Information**:
   - The individual is indifferent between bundle A (8 apples, 2 oranges) and bundle B (2 apples, 8 oranges): A ~ B.
   - The individual prefers bundle B to bundle C (6 apples, 6 oranges): B ≻ C.
   - We need to check if these preferences can be consistent with a preference relation that satisfies completeness, transitivity, monotonicity, and convexity.

2. **Assumptions on Preferences**:
   - **Completeness**: For any two bundles X and Y, either X ≽ Y, Y ≽ X, or both (X ~ Y).
   - **Transitivity**: If X ≽ Y and Y ≽ Z, then X ≽ Z.
   - **Monotonicity**: If bundle X has at least as much of both goods as bundle Y, and strictly more of at least one good, then X ≻ Y.
   - **Convexity**: The set of bundles preferred to or indifferent to a given bundle (the upper contour set) is convex. Equivalently, for any two bundles X and Y where X ~ Y, and for any α ∈ [0,1], the convex combination αX + (1-α)Y ≽ X.

3. **Analysis**:
   - **Completeness**: This assumption requires that the individual can compare any pair of bundles. The problem provides preferences for A ~ B and B ≻ C, but does not specify the preference between A and C or other pairs. Completeness can hold if we can define a preference relation that ranks all pairs consistently. Since no contradiction is implied yet, completeness is possible.
   - **Transitivity**: We have A ~ B and B ≻ C. Transitivity implies that A ≻ C (since A ~ B means A ≽ B, and B ≻ C implies B ≽ C and not C ≽ B, so A ≽ C and not C ≽ A). There are no other preference statements to contradict transitivity, so it can hold.
   - **Monotonicity**: Monotonicity requires that more of at least one good (with no less of the other) leads to a strictly preferred bundle. Compare:
     - Bundle A (8, 2) vs. C (6, 6): A has more apples (8 > 6) but fewer oranges (2 < 6). Monotonicity does not apply directly since neither bundle dominates the other.
     - Bundle B (2, 8) vs. C (6, 6): B has fewer apples (2 < 6) but more oranges (8 > 6). Again, monotonicity does not apply directly.
     - Bundle A (8, 2) vs. B (2, 8): A has more apples, B has more oranges, so monotonicity does not dictate a preference, consistent with A ~ B.
     - However, consider C (6, 6) vs. a bundle like (6, 7) (which has more oranges and the same apples). Monotonicity requires (6, 7) ≻ C. We don’t have direct information about (6, 7), but we need to ensure our preference relation respects such comparisons. The given preferences (A ~ B, B ≻ C) do not violate monotonicity directly, as the bundles are not strictly comparable in terms of “more.”
   - **Convexity**: Since A ~ B, convexity requires that for any α ∈ [0,1], the bundle αA + (1-α)B ≽ A. Compute the convex combination:
     - A = (8, 2), B = (2, 8).
     - αA + (1-α)B = α(8, 2) + (1-α)(2, 8) = (8α + 2(1-α), 2α + 8(1-α)) = (6α + 2, 8 - 6α).
     - We need (6α + 2, 8 - 6α) ≽ A for all α ∈ [0,1].
     - Check at α = ⅓: (6(⅓) + 2, 8 - 6(⅓)) = (2 + 2, 8 - 2) = (4, 6).
     - Now compare (4, 6) to C (6, 6). By monotonicity, since (6, 6) has more apples (6 > 4) and the same oranges (6 = 6), we expect (6, 6) ≻ (4, 6) (assuming strict monotonicity, where equality in one good still allows preference if the other good is greater).
     - If (6, 6) ≻ (4, 6), and (4, 6) ≽ A (by convexity), then by transitivity, (6, 6) ≻ A. But since A ~ B and B ≻ C (6, 6), we have A ≻ C by transitivity, which creates a potential issue:
       - C ≻ A (from convexity and monotonicity) contradicts A ≻ C (from A ~ B, B ≻ C).
     - This suggests a conflict. Let’s explore further by testing convexity at another point, say α = ½:
       - αA + (1-α)B = (½)(8, 2) + (½)(2, 8) = (4, 1) + (1, 4) = (5, 5).
       - Compare (5, 5) to C (6, 6). By monotonicity, (6, 6) ≻ (5, 5) since 6 > 5 in both goods.
       - Convexity requires (5, 5) ≽ A. If (6, 6) ≻ (5, 5) and (5, 5) ≽ A, then (6, 6) ≽ A, but since B ≻ C and A ~ B, A ≻ C, so C cannot be preferred to A.
     - The indifference A ~ B implies an indifference curve through (8, 2) and (2, 8). Convexity requires that points on the line segment between A and B (e.g., (5, 5) or (4, 6)) are at least as preferred as A or B. However, C (6, 6) is preferred to points like (5, 5) or (4, 6) by monotonicity, leading to a contradiction when combined with B ≻ C and A ~ B.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The preferences A ~ B and B ≻ C imply A ≻ C by transitivity.
   - Convexity requires that convex combinations of A and B (e.g., (5, 5) or (4, 6)) are at least as preferred as A.
   - Monotonicity implies that C (6, 6) is strictly preferred to bundles like (5, 5) or (4, 6).
   - This creates a contradiction: convexity and transitivity suggest C ≽ A (since C ≻ (5, 5) ≽ A), but A ≻ C is required by A ~ B and B ≻ C.
   - Therefore, the assumptions of completeness, transitivity, monotonicity, and convexity cannot hold together, as convexity conflicts with the preference structure implied by monotonicity and transitivity.

**Final Answer**: The four assumptions (completeness, transitivity, monotonicity, and convexity) cannot hold together in this case due to a conflict between convexity, monotonicity, and the given preferences (A ~ B, B ≻ C).
