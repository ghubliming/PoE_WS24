Let’s solve this step by step.

The individual maximizes utility $U(q_1, q_2) = q_1 + 2q_2$ subject to the budget constraint, given income $y = 100$, and prices $p_1 = 4$ and $p_2 = 5$. The budget constraint is:

$$
p_1 q_1 + p_2 q_2 = y \quad \Rightarrow \quad 4q_1 + 5q_2 = 100
$$

### Step 1: Determine the Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)
The utility function is $U(q_1, q_2) = q_1 + 2q_2$. The marginal utilities are:

- $MU_1 = \frac{\partial U}{\partial q_1} = 1$
- $MU_2 = \frac{\partial U}{\partial q_2} = 2$

The Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS) is:

$$
MRS = \frac{MU_1}{MU_2} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

### Step 2: Compare MRS with the Price Ratio
The price ratio is:

$$
\frac{p_1}{p_2} = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8
$$

Since $MRS = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 < 0.8 = \frac{p_1}{p_2}$, *the individual gets more utility per dollar spent on good 2 than on good 1*. This suggests a corner solution where the individual spends as much as possible on good 2.

### Step 3: Check for Corner Solutions
- **Spend all on good 2 ($q_1 = 0$)**:  
  Budget: $4(0) + 5q_2 = 100 \Rightarrow 5q_2 = 100 \Rightarrow q_2 = 20$.  
  So, $(q_1, q_2) = (0, 20)$.  
  Utility: $U(0, 20) = 0 + 2(20) = 40$.

- **Spend all on good 1 ($q_2 = 0$)**:  
  Budget: $4q_1 + 5(0) = 100 \Rightarrow 4q_1 = 100 \Rightarrow q_1 = 25$.  
  So, $(q_1, q_2) = (25, 0)$.  
  Utility: $U(25, 0) = 25 + 2(0) = 25$.

==*Since the utility function is linear, there’s no interior solution (MRS ≠ price ratio).*== The individual maximizes utility by spending all income on good 2, as $U(0, 20) = 40 > 25 = U(25, 0)$.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Options
- **(A) If the marginal rate of substitution and the price ratio are never equal, no optimal consumption bundle can be determined.**  
  False. The MRS and price ratio are not equal ($0.5 \neq 0.8$), but we can still determine the optimal bundle—it’s a corner solution.

- **(B) The individual spends her entire budget on good 2.**  
  True. As calculated, the optimal bundle is $(q_1, q_2) = (0, 20)$, meaning all income is spent on good 2.

- **(C) The optimal consumption bundle contains twice as many units of good 2 as of good 1.**  
  False. The bundle $(0, 20)$ has zero units of good 1, so this condition doesn’t hold.

- **(D) The individual spends her entire budget on good 1.**  
  False. The individual spends all on good 2, not good 1.

### Answer: **(B)**
