Let’s solve these step by step.

### Problem 6: Optimal consumption bundle before the price decrease
The utility function is $U(q_1, q_2) = q_1^{\frac{1}{2}} + q_2$, income $y = 80$, price of good 1 $p_1 = 1$, and price of good 2 $p_2 = 8$. We need to find the optimal consumption bundle.

The consumer maximizes utility subject to the budget constraint:
$$
p_1 q_1 + p_2 q_2 = y \implies 1 \cdot q_1 + 8 \cdot q_2 = 80 \implies q_1 + 8 q_2 = 80
$$

Using the utility function, we compute the marginal utilities:
- $MU_1 = \frac{\partial U}{\partial q_1} = \frac{1}{2} q_1^{-\frac{1}{2}}$
- $MU_2 = \frac{\partial U}{\partial q_2} = 1$

The marginal rate of substitution (MRS) is:
$$
MRS = \frac{MU_1}{MU_2} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} q_1^{-\frac{1}{2}}}{1} = \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{q_1}}
$$

At the optimal bundle, the MRS equals the price ratio:
$$
\frac{MU_1}{MU_2} = \frac{p_1}{p_2} \implies \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{q_1}} = \frac{1}{8} \implies 2 \sqrt{q_1} = 8 \implies \sqrt{q_1} = 4 \implies q_1 = 16
$$

Substitute $q_1 = 16$ into the budget constraint:
$$
16 + 8 q_2 = 80 \implies 8 q_2 = 64 \implies q_2 = 8
$$

==So, the optimal bundle is $(q_1, q_2) = (16, 8)$.==

**Answer for Problem 6: (B)**

### Problem 7: Optimal consumption bundle after the price decrease
I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Let’s solve Problem 7 again with clarity.

**Problem 7:** After the price decrease of good 2 from $p_2 = 8$ to $p_2 = 4$, we need to find the individual’s optimal consumption bundle and the resulting expenditure. The utility function is $U(q_1, q_2) = q_1^{\frac{1}{2}} + q_2$, income $y = 80$, and price of good 1 is $p_1 = 1$.

The new budget constraint is:
$$
q_1 + 4 q_2 = 80
$$

Compute the marginal utilities:
- $MU_1 = \frac{\partial U}{\partial q_1} = \frac{1}{2} q_1^{-\frac{1}{2}}$
- $MU_2 = \frac{\partial U}{\partial q_2} = 1$

The MRS is:
$$
\frac{MU_1}{MU_2} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} q_1^{-\frac{1}{2}}}{1} = \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{q_1}}
$$

Set MRS equal to the price ratio:
$$
\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{q_1}} = \frac{p_1}{p_2} = \frac{1}{4} \implies 2 \sqrt{q_1} = 4 \implies \sqrt{q_1} = 2 \implies q_1 = 4
$$

Substitute $q_1 = 4$ into the budget constraint:
$$
4 + 4 q_2 = 80 \implies 4 q_2 = 76 \implies q_2 = 19
$$

So, the optimal bundle is $(q_1, q_2) = (4, 19)$.

Now, calculate the expenditures:
- Expenditure on good 1: $p_1 \cdot q_1 = 1 \cdot 4 = 4$
- Expenditure on good 2: $p_2 \cdot q_2 = 4 \cdot 19 = 76$

The question asks for the "expenses" and provides options:
- (A) 24 for good 1
- (B) 40 for good 1
- (C) 60 for good 2
- (D) 76 for good 2

The expenditure on good 1 ($4$) doesn’t match (A) or (B). The expenditure on good 2 ($76$) matches (D).

Given the options, the question likely intends to ask for the expenditure on good 2, as option (D) fits perfectly.

**Answer for Problem 7: (D)**

I apologize for the earlier oversight and any confusion caused. This matches the correct expenditure on good 2.

### Problem 8: Income effect for good 1
The income effect (IE) for good 1 is the change in $q_1$ due to the change in real income, holding prices constant at the new price level.

1. **Slutsky decomposition**: The total change in $q_1$ is:
   $$
   q_1^{\text{new}} - q_1^{\text{old}} = 4 - 16 = -12
$$

2. **Substitution effect (SE)**: ==At the new prices $(p_1, p_2) = (1, 4)$, we find the bundle that gives the *original* utility $U = 4 + 8 = 12$.== Solve:
   $$
   \sqrt{q_1} + q_2 = 12, \quad q_1 + 4 q_2 = m
$$
   ==Minimize cost $m$ subject to $U = 12$==. Using the tangency condition:
   $$
   \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{q_1}} = \frac{1}{4} \implies q_1 = 4, \quad q_2 = 12 - \sqrt{4} = 10
$$
   So, the Hicksian bundle is $(4, 10)$. The substitution effect is:
   $SE = q_{Hicksian} - q_{old}$
   $$
   SE_1 = 4 - 16 = -12
$$

3. **Income effect**:
   $$
   IE_1 = (q_1^{\text{new}} - q_1^{\text{Hicksian}}) = 4 - 4 = 0
$$

**Answer for Problem 8: (B)**

### Problem 9: Substitution effect for good 2
The substitution effect for good 2:
$$
SE_2 = q_2^{\text{Hicksian}} - q_2^{\text{old}} = 10 - 8 = 2
$$

**Answer for Problem 9: (C)**

### Problem 10: Income necessary to reach the same utility
Original utility is $U = 12$. After the price decrease, find the income $y$ needed to achieve $U = 12$ at $(p_1, p_2) = (1, 4)$.

Using the tangency condition:
>[!tip]
in the context of Problem 10, the values q1=4  and q2=10 that we calculated are indeed Hicksian demands.

$$
q_1 = 4, \quad q_2 = 12 - 2 = 10
$$
Cost of this bundle:
$$
1 \cdot 4 + 4 \cdot 10 = 4 + 40 = 44
$$
