MRTS to solve 
L → w
K → r

The method used here for solving the cost minimization problem is a standard approach in microeconomics, often applied in production theory to find the optimal input combination (labor $L$ and capital $K$) that produces a given output level at the lowest cost. Here's the general method:

1. **Understand the Production Function and Output Constraint**: Start with the production function $q = F(L, K)$, which relates inputs $L$ and $K$ to output $q$. The goal is to produce a specific output level $q$, so the constraint is $F(L, K) = q$.

2. **Identify the Cost Function**: The total variable cost is given by $c = wL + rK$, where $w$ is the wage rate (cost of labor) and $r$ is the rental rate (cost of capital). The objective is to minimize this cost.

3. **Use the Isoquant and Isocost Framework**: 
   - An **isoquant** represents all combinations of $L$ and $K$ that produce the given output $q$. It’s derived from the production function.
   - An **isocost line** represents all combinations of $L$ and $K$ that can be purchased for a given cost, based on the equation $C = wL + rK$. The slope of the isocost line is $-w/r$.

4. **Find the Optimal Input Bundle (Tangency Condition)**: The cost-minimizing input bundle occurs where the isoquant is tangent to the lowest possible isocost line. At this point, the slope of the isoquant (the marginal rate of technical substitution, MRTS) equals the slope of the isocost line (the input price ratio $w/r$).
   - The MRTS is the rate at which one input can be substituted for another while keeping output constant, given by $MRTS_{L,K} = \frac{MP_L}{MP_K}$, where $MP_L$ and $MP_K$ are the marginal products of labor and capital.
   - At optimality: $MRTS_{L,K} = \frac{w}{r}$, or equivalently, $\frac{MP_L}{w} = \frac{MP_K}{r}$. This means the marginal product per dollar spent on each input is equalized.

5. **Solve for $L$ and $K$**: Using the tangency condition ($MRTS = w/r$) and the output constraint ($F(L, K) = q$), solve these two equations simultaneously to find the optimal $L$ and $K$.

6. **Compute the Minimum Cost**: Substitute the optimal $L$ and $K$ into the cost function $c = wL + rK$ to find the minimum cost for producing the given output.

This method ensures that the firm allocates resources efficiently, producing the desired output at the lowest possible cost by balancing the trade-offs between inputs based on their relative prices and productivity.
