### Problem 6: Marginal Costs Comparison

#### What the Question is Asking
The problem provides the short-run and long-run total cost functions for a firm:
- Short-run: $C(q) = 200 + 2q^2$, for $q \geq 0$
- Long-run: $C(q) = 200 + 2q^2$ for $q > 0$, and $C(q) = 0$ for $q = 0$

For $q = 20$, we need to determine the relationship between marginal costs (MC) and average total costs (AC). The options are:
- (A) MC equal AC
- (B) MC higher than AC
- (C) MC equal average variable costs (AVC)
- (D) MC lower than AVC

#### Step-by-Step Explanation of the Solution

**Step 1: Calculate Marginal Cost (MC)**
- **Explanation of Reasoning:** ==Marginal cost is the additional cost of producing one more unit of output. We need MC to compare it with AC.== ^g0ok73
- **Methods and Concepts:** MC is the derivative of the total cost function $C(q)$ with respect to $q$. For the short-run cost function $C(q) = 200 + 2q^2$, we compute:
  $$
  MC(q) = \frac{dC}{dq} = \frac{d}{dq}(200 + 2q^2) = 0 + 4q = 4q
$$
  At $q = 20$:
  $$
  MC(20) = 4 \times 20 = 80
$$
- **Assumptions and Definitions:** We assume the cost function is differentiable. MC is defined as the change in total cost per unit change in output.

**Step 2: Calculate Average Total Cost (AC)**
- **Explanation of Reasoning:** AC is the total cost per unit of output, which we need to compare with MC.
- **Methods and Concepts:** AC is total cost divided by quantity: $AC(q) = \frac{C(q)}{q}$. Using the short-run cost function:
  $$
  AC(q) = \frac{200 + 2q^2}{q} = \frac{200}{q} + 2q
$$
  At $q = 20$:
  $$
  AC(20) = \frac{200}{20} + 2 \times 20 = 10 + 40 = 50
$$
- **Assumptions and Definitions:** We assume $q \neq 0$. AC includes both fixed and variable costs per unit.

**Step 3: Compare MC and AC**
- **Explanation of Reasoning:** We compare the values of MC and AC at $q = 20$ to determine their relationship.
- **Methods and Concepts:** Direct numerical comparison:
  $$
  MC(20) = 80, \quad AC(20) = 50
$$
  Since $80 > 50$, marginal costs are higher than average total costs.
- **Assumptions and Definitions:** No additional assumptions needed here.

**Step 4: Evaluate Other Options (C and D)**
- **Explanation of Reasoning:** To confirm the answer, we can briefly check options involving average variable costs (AVC).
- ==**Methods and Concepts:** AVC is the variable cost per unit. The variable cost in $C(q) = 200 + 2q^2$ is $2q^2$, so:==
  $$
  AVC(q) = \frac{2q^2}{q} = 2q
$$
  At $q = 20$:
  $$
  AVC(20) = 2 \times 20 = 40
$$
  - Option (C): MC = AVC? $80 \neq 40$, so incorrect.
  - Option (D): MC < AVC? $80 > 40$, so incorrect.
- **Assumptions and Definitions:** The fixed cost is 200 (when $q = 0$), and variable cost is $2q^2$.

**Overall Summary for Problem 6:**
The solution calculates MC as $4q = 80$ and AC as $\frac{200}{q} + 2q = 50$ at $q = 20$. Since $80 > 50$, marginal costs are higher than average total costs, making option (B) correct. Options (C) and (D) are ruled out by comparing MC with AVC, which is 40.

### Problem 7: Firm’s Supply with $p = 20$

#### What the Question is Asking
Given $p = 20$, we need to find the firm’s supply (output $q$) in the short run and long run. The options are:
- (A) $q = 0$ in both short and long run
- (B) $q = 5$ in short run, $q = 0$ in long run
- (C) $q = 10$ in short run, $q = 0$ in long run
- (D) $q = 20$ in both short and long run

#### Step-by-Step Explanation of the Solution

**Step 1: Short-Run Supply (Profit Maximization)**
- **Explanation of Reasoning:** A price-taking firm maximizes profit by producing where price equals marginal cost ($p = MC$), as long as price covers average variable costs (AVC) to avoid shutting down.
- **Methods and Concepts:** From Problem 6, $MC(q) = 4q$. Set $p = MC$:
  $$
  20 = 4q \implies q = 5
$$
  Check if the firm produces by comparing $p$ with AVC at $q = 5$:
  $$
  AVC(q) = 2q \quad \text{(from Problem 6)}, \quad AVC(5) = 2 \times 5 = 10
$$
  Since $p = 20 > 10 = AVC(5)$, the firm produces $q = 5$ in the short run.
- **Assumptions and Definitions:** The firm operates if $p \geq AVC$; otherwise, it shuts down ($q = 0$).

**Step 2: Long-Run Supply (Profit Maximization)**
- **Explanation of Reasoning:** In the long run, the firm produces where $p = MC$, but it must also cover average total costs (AC) to avoid exiting the market.
- **Methods and Concepts:** Using $MC = 4q$, we already found $p = 20 \implies q = 5$. Now compute AC at $q = 5$:
  $$
  AC(q) = \frac{200}{q} + 2q \quad \text{(from Problem 6)}
$$
  $$
  AC(5) = \frac{200}{5} + 2 \times 5 = 40 + 10 = 50
$$
  Compare $p$ with AC:
  $$
  p = 20 < 50 = AC(5)
$$
  Since $p < AC$, the firm cannot cover its total costs and will exit the market in the long run, producing $q = 0$.
- **Assumptions and Definitions:** In the long run, all costs are variable (no fixed costs if $q = 0$, as per the long-run cost function), and the firm exits if it cannot break even ($p \geq AC$).

**Step 3: Combine Results**
- **Explanation of Reasoning:** The firm supplies $q = 5$ in the short run and $q = 0$ in the long run.
- **Methods and Concepts:** Match with the options:
  - (B) $q = 5$ in short run, $q = 0$ in long run, which matches our result.
- **Assumptions and Definitions:** No additional assumptions needed.

**Overall Summary for Problem 7:**
The firm sets $p = MC = 4q$, so at $p = 20$, $q = 5$. In the short run, $p = 20 > AVC(5) = 10$, so it produces $q = 5$. In the long run, $p = 20 < AC(5) = 50$, so it exits, producing $q = 0$. Option (B) is correct.

### Problem 8: Threshold Price for Positive Supply in the Long Run

#### What the Question is Asking
We need to find the threshold price $p$ above which the firm supplies $q > 0$ in the long run. Options are:
- (A) $p = 10$
- (B) $p = 20$
- (C) $p = 30$
- (D) $p = 40$

#### Step-by-Step Explanation of the Solution

**Step 1: Long-Run Condition for Positive Supply**
- **Explanation of Reasoning:** In the long run, the firm produces $q > 0$ if it can at least break even, i.e., where $p \geq AC$. The minimum AC is the threshold price.
- **Methods and Concepts:** From Problem 6, $AC(q) = \frac{200}{q} + 2q$. To find the minimum AC, take the derivative and set it to zero:
  $$
  AC(q) = \frac{200}{q} + 2q
$$
  $$
  \frac{dAC}{dq} = -\frac{200}{q^2} + 2 = 0
$$
  $$
  2 = \frac{200}{q^2} \implies q^2 = 100 \implies q = 10 \quad (\text{since } q > 0)
$$

**Step 2: Calculate Minimum AC**
- **Explanation of Reasoning:** Evaluate AC at $q = 10$ to find the threshold price.
- **Methods and Concepts:** Substitute $q = 10$:
  $$
  AC(10) = \frac{200}{10} + 2 \times 10 = 20 + 20 = 40
$$
- **Assumptions and Definitions:** The minimum AC occurs where ==$MC = AC$==. Check: $MC(q) = 4q$, so $MC(10) = 4 \times 10 = 40$, which equals $AC(10)$, confirming the minimum.

**Step 3: Determine Threshold Price**
- **Explanation of Reasoning:** The firm supplies $q > 0$ if $p \geq \text{minimum AC} = 40$. Thus, the threshold price is 40.
- **Methods and Concepts:** Match with options: (D) $p = 40$.
- **Assumptions and Definitions:** We assume the firm produces where $p = MC$ and $p \geq AC$.

**Overall Summary for Problem 8:**
The threshold price for $q > 0$ in the long run is the minimum AC. We minimize $AC(q) = \frac{200}{q} + 2q$, finding the minimum at $q = 10$, where $AC = 40$. Thus, $p = 40$, and option (D) is correct.

### Final Summary Across All Problems
- **Problem 6:** At $q = 20$, $MC = 80 > AC = 50$, so option (B) is correct.
- **Problem 7:** With $p = 20$, the firm supplies $q = 5$ in the short run ($p > AVC$) and $q = 0$ in the long run ($p < AC$), so option (B) is correct.
- **Problem 8:** The threshold price for positive supply in the long run is the minimum AC, which is 40 at $q = 10$, so option (D) is correct.

The solutions use standard microeconomic concepts like marginal cost, average cost, and profit maximization, with clear derivations and comparisons to determine the firm’s behavior in both short and long runs.

## Core Concepts

A firm's primary objective is to maximize profit, which is the difference between total revenue (TR) and total cost (TC).

$$ Profit = TR - TC $$

To find the maximum profit, a firm must analyze its revenue and costs at different levels of output.

- **Total Revenue (TR)**: The total amount of money a firm receives from the sale of its output. $TR = Price (P) \times Quantity (Q)$
- **Total Cost (TC)**: The market value of the inputs a firm uses in production. This includes both fixed and variable costs.

The profit-maximizing level of output is where the marginal revenue (MR) equals the marginal cost (MC).

$$ MR = MC $$

For a firm in a perfectly competitive market, the price is determined by the market, so the firm is a price taker. In this case, the price is equal to the marginal revenue ($P = MR$). Therefore, the profit-maximization rule for a competitive firm is to produce at the quantity where price equals marginal cost.

$$ P = MC $$
