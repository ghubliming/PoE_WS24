# P1 Production Function 
about the Production Function: q = F(L, K), derivative to L/K first and second order(for convex analysis)
- add Lambda to function to see how the return changes

# P2 Cost minimization
MRTS(derivative of L,K ~ w/r); cost function(wL+rK)

# P6-8 Profit Maximization
MC,AC,AvC, also important for lec4



[[(P6-8 Profit Maximization--Ex3 Production and Supply) (SS25-PoE_Retake-3)]]
Need to know: MC, AC, AvC(ac)
We have q, 
cal the p = MC(q)
in the short run, compare the MC with AvC, if MC > AvC → Run, others not
in the long run, compare MC with AC, MC > AC → run, others not → q = 0
