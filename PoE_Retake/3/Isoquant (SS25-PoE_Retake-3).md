Let’s dive deeper into the concept of an **isoquant** and its properties in the context of part (c) of your problem, where we’re working with the production function $q = F(L, K) = L^a K^b$. I’ll break this down to make it clear, especially since you’re new to the term.

### What is an Isoquant?

An **isoquant** (short for "iso-quantity") is a concept from economics, specifically in production theory. It’s a curve that shows all the combinations of two inputs—like labor ($L$) and capital ($K$)—that produce the same level of output ($q$). Think of it as a "contour line" on a production map: just as a contour line on a topographic map connects points of equal elevation, an isoquant connects points of equal output.

For the production function $q = L^a K^b$, an isoquant is defined by setting output to a constant value, say $\bar{q}$:
$$
L^a K^b = \bar{q}
$$
This equation describes all combinations of $L$ and $K$ that yield the same output $\bar{q}$. For example, if you use more labor ($L$), you can use less capital ($K$) to keep output constant, and the isoquant shows this trade-off.

### Visualizing the Isoquant

If we solve for $K$ in terms of $L$:
$$
L^a K^b = \bar{q} \quad \Rightarrow \quad K^b = \frac{\bar{q}}{L^a} \quad \Rightarrow \quad K = \left( \frac{\bar{q}}{L^a} \right)^{1/b} = \bar{q}^{1/b} L^{-a/b}
$$
This equation, $K = \bar{q}^{1/b} L^{-a/b}$, describes the shape of the isoquant in the $L$-$K$ plane (where $L$ is on the x-axis and $K$ is on the y-axis). The isoquant slopes downward because as you increase $L$, you need less $K$ to maintain the same output. This negative slope reflects the trade-off between the two inputs, often called the **marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS)**, which is the rate at which you can substitute $L$ for $K$ while keeping output constant.

### What Does "Strictly Convex" Mean?

In part (c), we’re asked to show that the isoquants are **strictly convex**. Let’s unpack this:

- **Convexity** in this context means that the isoquant curves "bow inward" toward the origin when plotted in the $L$-$K$ plane. If you draw a straight line between any two points on the isoquant, the line will lie *above* the isoquant (except at the endpoints). This shape implies that substituting one input for another becomes harder as you use more of one input and less of the other—it’s a diminishing rate of substitution.
  
- **Strictly convex** means the isoquant doesn’t have any flat sections; it’s always curving inward. Mathematically, when $K$ is expressed as a function of $L$, the second derivative $\frac{d^2 K}{dL^2}$ must be positive, indicating that the curve is always bending upward.

### Why Are Isoquants Convex in This Case?

The convexity of isoquants is tied to the production function’s properties, particularly the **diminishing marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS)**. Let’s compute the MRTS and examine the shape of the isoquant.

#### Step 1: Compute the MRTS
The MRTS is the slope of the isoquant, $\frac{dK}{dL}$. It can also be found as the ratio of the marginal products of the inputs:
- Marginal product of labor ($MPL$): $\frac{\partial q}{\partial L} = a L^{a-1} K^b$
- Marginal product of capital ($MPK$): $\frac{\partial q}{\partial K} = b L^a K^{b-1}$

The MRTS is:
$$
MRTS = \frac{MPL}{MPK} = \frac{a L^{a-1} K^b}{b L^a K^{b-1}} = \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{K}{L}
$$
The slope of the isoquant is the negative of the MRTS (since the isoquant slopes downward):
$$
\frac{dK}{dL} = - \frac{MPL}{MPK} = - \frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{K}{L}
$$
Alternatively, we can compute $\frac{dK}{dL}$ directly from the isoquant equation $K = \bar{q}^{1/b} L^{-a/b}$:
$$
\frac{dK}{dL} = \frac{d}{dL} \left( \bar{q}^{1/b} L^{-a/b} \right) = \bar{q}^{1/b} \left( -\frac{a}{b} \right) L^{-a/b - 1}
$$
This slope is negative (since $-\frac{a}{b} < 0$), confirming that the isoquant slopes downward.

#### Step 2: Check Convexity with the Second Derivative
To confirm strict convexity, compute the second derivative of $K$ with respect to $L$:
$$
\frac{dK}{dL} = \bar{q}^{1/b} \left( -\frac{a}{b} \right) L^{-a/b - 1}
$$
$$
\frac{d^2 K}{dL^2} = \frac{d}{dL} \left( \bar{q}^{1/b} \left( -\frac{a}{b} \right) L^{-a/b - 1} \right) = \bar{q}^{1/b} \left( -\frac{a}{b} \right) \left( -\frac{a}{b} - 1 \right) L^{-a/b - 2}
$$
- $\bar{q}^{1/b} > 0$ (since $\bar{q} > 0$)
- $-\frac{a}{b} < 0$
- $-\frac{a}{b} - 1 = -\left( \frac{a}{b} + 1 \right) < 0$ (since $\frac{a}{b} > 0$)
- The exponent $-a/b - 2 < 0$, but $L^{-a/b - 2} > 0$ (since $L > 0$)

Now, evaluate the sign of $\frac{d^2 K}{dL^2}$:
- $\left( -\frac{a}{b} \right) \left( -\frac{a}{b} - 1 \right) = \left( -\frac{a}{b} \right) \left( -\left( \frac{a}{b} + 1 \right) \right) = \left( -\frac{a}{b} \right) (-1) \left( \frac{a}{b} + 1 \right) = \frac{a}{b} \left( \frac{a}{b} + 1 \right)$, which is positive since $\frac{a}{b} > 0$.

Thus, $\frac{d^2 K}{dL^2} > 0$, confirming that the isoquant is **strictly convex**.

### Intuition Behind Convexity

The convexity of the isoquant reflects the idea of diminishing MRTS:
- As you move along the isoquant (increasing $L$ and decreasing $K$), the MRTS $\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{K}{L}$ decreases because $\frac{K}{L}$ decreases.
- This means that as you use more labor and less capital, each additional unit of labor substitutes for less and less capital—hence the isoquant curves inward.

In economic terms, this convexity makes sense: if you have a lot of labor and little capital, adding more labor doesn’t help as much, so you’d need a lot more capital to compensate for a small reduction in labor. This diminishing substitutability leads to the convex shape.

### Why Does Convexity Matter?

Convex isoquants are important in production theory because they imply:
1. **Smooth Substitution:** Inputs can be substituted for each other, but at a diminishing rate, which is realistic for most production processes.
2. **Cost Minimization:** When firms minimize costs (choosing the cheapest combination of inputs to produce a given output), convex isoquants ensure there’s a unique optimal combination of inputs (where the isoquant is tangent to the firm’s budget line, or "isocost" line).

If isoquants were not convex (e.g., if they were straight lines or concave), firms might face corner solutions (using only one input) or other unrealistic outcomes.

### Summary

- An **isoquant** shows all combinations of $L$ and $K$ that produce a fixed output $\bar{q}$ for the production function $q = L^a K^b$.
- The isoquant is described by $K = \bar{q}^{1/b} L^{-a/b}$, which slopes downward.
- It’s **strictly convex** because $\frac{d^2 K}{dL^2} > 0$, meaning it bows inward toward the origin.
- This convexity reflects a diminishing marginal rate of technical substitution, a realistic feature of production where substituting one input for another becomes harder as you rely more on one input.
