The production function $q = F(L, K) = (L \cdot K)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ represents a Cobb-Douglas form, where $q$ is the output, $L$ is labor, and $K$ is capital. The exponent $\frac{1}{2}$ indicates diminishing marginal returns to each input when the other is fixed. Here, $L \geq 0$ and $K \geq 0$ are the inputs the firm uses to produce $q$. For $q = 100$, the equation $(L \cdot K)^{\frac{1}{2}} = 100$ implies $L \cdot K = 10000$, showing the trade-off between labor and capital to maintain output. The firm minimizes costs by choosing the optimal $L$ and $K$ based on input prices (wage rate $w$ for labor, rental rate $r$ for capital).
