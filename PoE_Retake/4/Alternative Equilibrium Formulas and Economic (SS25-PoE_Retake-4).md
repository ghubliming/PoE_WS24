You're absolutely right to raise this question ‚Äî it's sharp and shows you're thinking critically.

Let's clarify why the ‚Äúalternative‚Äù formulas in **Problem 1(b)** are **not actually alternative**, and why they're **entirely consistent with the derivation in part (a)**. In fact, there is no sudden switch to a different model ‚Äî it's a continuation, just from a different mathematical angle.

## üîÅ How Part (b) Connects to Part (a)

In **Part (a)**, we derived the **threshold condition** for zero-profit equilibrium:

$$
n^* = \max\left\{ \left\lfloor \frac{a}{\sqrt{c^f}} - 2 \right\rfloor,\, 0 \right\}
$$

This comes from:

* Market demand:‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ
  $Q^D(p) = a - p$
* Market supply (from individual firms):
  $Q^S(p) = \frac{n}{2}p$ if $p \geq 2\sqrt{c^f}$

And at **zero profit**, we set:

$$
Q^D\left(2\sqrt{c^f}\right) = Q^S\left(2\sqrt{c^f}\right)
$$

Solve this for $n$ ‚Üí get the threshold condition.

In **Part (b)**, instead of **solving for the threshold price**, we assume the number of firms $n^*$ is known and **re-express the system from another angle**: compute the equilibrium price, output, and profit **in terms of $n^*$**.

> This is **not a new model**. It's just algebraic substitution:
> Plug $n^*$ into demand and supply formulas and solve.

## ‚úÖ Justification for the ‚ÄúAlternative Formulas‚Äù

Given:

* Demand: $Q^D(p) = a - p$
* Supply: $Q^S(p) = \frac{n^*}{2}p$

Set equilibrium: $Q^D(p) = Q^S(p)$

$$
a - p = \frac{n^*}{2}p \quad \Rightarrow \quad a = p\left(1 + \frac{n^*}{2}\right) = p\left(\frac{n^* + 2}{2}\right)
$$

$$
\Rightarrow \boxed{p^* = \frac{2a}{n^* + 2}}
$$

From there:

* $q^* = \frac{1}{2}p^* = \frac{a}{n^* + 2}$
* $Q^* = n^* q^* = \frac{an^*}{n^* + 2}$

### üîÅ Given Cost Function

From your image (Problem 1 setup), each firm's cost is:

$$
C(q) = 
\begin{cases}
c^f + q^2, & q > 0 \\
0, & q = 0
\end{cases}
$$

This means:

* **Marginal cost**: $MC(q) = 2q$
* **Average cost**: $AC(q) = \frac{c^f + q^2}{q} = \frac{c^f}{q} + q$

So a firm‚Äôs **total cost** is not just $c^f$, but $c^f + q^2$.
### ‚úÖ Firm‚Äôs Revenue and Profit

Each firm sells output $q^* = \frac{a}{n^* + 2}$, and equilibrium price is $p^* = \frac{2a}{n^* + 2}$.
So firm revenue:

$$
R = p^* \cdot q^* = \frac{2a}{n^* + 2} \cdot \frac{a}{n^* + 2} = \frac{2a^2}{(n^* + 2)^2}
$$

Cost:

$$
C(q^*) = c^f + \left( \frac{a}{n^* + 2} \right)^2 = c^f + \frac{a^2}{(n^* + 2)^2}
$$

Therefore, **profit per firm**:

$$
\pi^* = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} = \frac{2a^2}{(n^* + 2)^2} - \left( c^f + \frac{a^2}{(n^* + 2)^2} \right)
$$

Simplify:

$$
\pi^* = \frac{2a^2 - a^2}{(n^* + 2)^2} - c^f = \frac{a^2}{(n^* + 2)^2} - c^f
$$

‚úÖ This matches exactly what's written in your solution:

$$
\boxed{\pi^* = \frac{a^2}{(n^* + 2)^2} - c^f}
$$


---

## ‚úÖ Bottom Line

* The so-called ‚Äúalternative‚Äù formulas in Part (b) are **reformulations** of the same model using known $n^*$
* They're used to compute **price, quantity, and profit** after solving for the number of firms using the threshold condition in Part (a)
* So, there's no shift in theory ‚Äî just different algebra applied at a different stage of the solution
