# P1 competitive Equilibrium
[[(P1 competitive Equilibrium--Ex 4 Perfect Competition) (SS25-PoE_Retake-4)]]


Just use p = MC
MC = AC [[condition for max Profit (SS25-PoE_Retake-4)]]


>[!tip]
>- **p** represents the market price
>- **π** (pi) represents profit for an individual firm

[[Consumer Surplus & Producer Surplus(SS25-PoE_Retake-4)]]

- Surplus
- Consumer want to buy even with higher price → same p with *less* q
- Producer want to sell even with lower price → same q with *lower* p

[[Welfare Loss (SS25-PoE_Retake-4)]]
- WL is calculated with the price ceiling resulted Total Surplus change
- also can use this to cal [[SS25/PoE_Retake/5/(P2-4 Monopoly--Ex 5 Market Failure) (SS25-PoE_Retake-5)#^kyzp7d]]
