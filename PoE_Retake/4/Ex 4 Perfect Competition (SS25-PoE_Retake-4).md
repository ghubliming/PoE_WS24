# P1 competitive Equilibrium
n companies. Market Demand $Q^{D}$, individual cost C(q), n use under floor
- Has Routine for such question [[Solve Routine For Ex4 Competition Problems (SS25-PoE_Retake-4)]]
- for number of firms and profit per firm in equilibrium cal now the function of $p(n)$ and $Q(n)$ /n → $q(n)$ and profit $\pi = pq - cost$
- tax $t$ is just cost $C(q)+t$
- WL is lost output(Q) bcs the tax → $\frac{1}{2} tax \Delta Q$

Just use p = MC
MC = AC [[condition for max Profit (SS25-PoE_Retake-4)]]

Then 2 surplus, CS(use $Q^{D}(p)$), PS(use $Q^{S}(p)$), both triangle area
- Price celling floor, usually ceiling hurt the Welfare
- WL = TS = CS + PS

[[Consumer Surplus & Producer Surplus(SS25-PoE_Retake-4)]]

- Surplus
- Consumer want to buy even with higher price → same p with *less* q
- Producer want to sell even with lower price → same q with *lower* p

[[Welfare Loss (SS25-PoE_Retake-4)]]
- WL is calculated with the price ceiling resulted Total Surplus change
- also can use this to cal [[SS25/PoE_Retake/5/(P2-4 Monopoly--Ex 5 Market Failure) (SS25-PoE_Retake-5)#^kyzp7d]]
