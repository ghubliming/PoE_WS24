## Key Concepts in the Market Supply and Demand Calculation

### Market Demand

- The market demand function is given as: $Q^D(p) = a - p$
- This is a linear demand curve where:
    - $a$ is the maximum price consumers are willing to pay
    - As price increases, quantity demanded decreases
    - At price $p = a$, demand falls to zero

### Individual Firm Supply

The solution derives the individual firm supply in these steps:

1. **Profit maximization**: ==Each firm sets price equal to marginal cost==
    
    - $MC(q) = 2q$ (derivative of cost function $C(q) = c^f + q^2$)
    - Therefore $p = 2q$, which gives $q = \frac{p}{2}$
2. **Break-even condition**: In long-run competitive equilibrium, firms earn zero economic profit
    
    - This gives us $p = 2\sqrt{c^f}$ (the break-even price)
    - At this price, each firm produces $q = \sqrt{c^f}$

### Market Supply

- With $n$ identical firms, market supply is: $Q^S(p) = n \cdot q(p) = n \cdot \frac{p}{2}$ for $p \geq 2\sqrt{c^f}$
- This is why the solution uses $Q^S(p) = n\sqrt{c^f}$ at the equilibrium price

### Finding Equilibrium

The solution sets market demand equal to market supply at the break-even price:

- $Q^D(p) = Q^S(p)$
- $a - 2\sqrt{c^f} = n\sqrt{c^f}$
- This gives us $n = \frac{a}{\sqrt{c^f}} - 2$

## Why This Approach Works

This calculation method is guided by three key principles of competitive markets:

1. **Zero economic profit in long run**: Firms enter or exit until profits are zero
    
    - This is why the solution sets $\frac{p^2}{4} - c^f = 0$ to find the break-even price
2. **Price-taking behavior**: Firms take market price as given and optimize their output
    
    - Each firm produces where $p = MC(q)$
3. **Market clearing**: Supply equals demand at equilibrium price
    

With a tax, the approach is similar but adjusted:

- The per-unit tax effectively shifts the marginal cost curve upward by $t$
- This leads to a higher market price: $p = 2\sqrt{c^f} + t$
- Which reduces the equilibrium number of firms to: $n = \frac{a-t}{\sqrt{c^f}} - 2$

This systematic approach allows us to determine exactly how many firms will operate in equilibrium as a function of the demand parameter $a$, fixed cost $c^f$, and (when applicable) tax $t$.
