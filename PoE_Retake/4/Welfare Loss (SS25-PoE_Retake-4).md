### Explanation of Welfare Loss

**Welfare Loss** (also called deadweight loss) occurs when a market is not operating at its equilibrium due to interventions like price floors, price ceilings, taxes, or subsidies. ==It represents the loss of total economic surplus (consumer surplus + producer surplus) that results from inefficient allocation of resources, where some mutually beneficial transactions do not occur.==
==它代表了由于资源效率低下而导致的总经济盈余损失（消费者盈余 +生产者盈余），在这些资源分配效率低下，在这些资源中不会发生一些互惠互利的交易。====

- **Consumer Surplus**: The difference between what consumers are willing to pay and what they actually pay.
- **Producer Surplus**: The difference between what producers receive and the minimum they are willing to accept.
- **Total Surplus**: The sum of consumer and producer surplus, maximized at market equilibrium.

When a market intervention like a price floor or ceiling distorts the equilibrium price and quantity, it reduces the quantity traded below the efficient level, leading to a welfare loss. This loss is typically visualized as a triangle on a supply-demand graph, representing the value of foregone transactions.

### Situation When There Is a Welfare Loss: Binding Price Floor

To illustrate welfare loss, let’s consider a **binding price floor**, where the price floor is set **above** the equilibrium price (unlike the non-binding case in your example). A binding price floor causes a surplus (excess supply) because the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded at the higher price.

### Why No Welfare Loss in Your Example?
In your provided problem, the price floor is set at $P = 20$, **below** the equilibrium price of $P = 25$. This makes it **non-binding**:
- Firms can still sell at $P = 25$, and consumers are willing to buy at that price.
- The market remains at equilibrium ($P = 25, Q = 100$).
- Since there’s no distortion in price or quantity, **consumer surplus**, **producer surplus**, and **total surplus** are unchanged.
- **Welfare Loss = 0**.

### General Situations Causing Welfare Loss
Welfare loss occurs in the following cases:
1. **Binding Price Floor**: Price floor above equilibrium (e.g., minimum wage above market wage), causing a surplus.
2. **Binding Price Ceiling**: Price ceiling below equilibrium (e.g., rent control), causing a shortage.
3. **Taxes**: Reduce quantity traded by increasing the price paid by buyers and reducing the price received by sellers.
4. **Subsidies**: Can distort markets by encouraging overproduction, though they may also correct externalities.
5. **Quotas**: Limit quantity traded below equilibrium, reducing surplus.

### Summary
- **Welfare Loss**: Occurs when market interventions prevent the market from reaching equilibrium, reducing total surplus.
- **Binding Price Floor Example**: A price floor at $P = 30$ (above equilibrium $P = 25$) reduces quantity traded to 80, creating a surplus and a welfare loss (e.g., 100 in the example).
- **Non-Binding Price Floor (Your Case)**: A price floor at $P = 20$ (below equilibrium $P = 25$) has no effect, so welfare loss = 0.
- **Graphically**: Welfare loss is the triangle between supply and demand curves for the foregone transactions.

# Example Scenario
Let’s dive into a clear and correct example to illustrate the welfare loss due to a price floor. We’ll use a simple market with straightforward demand and supply functions, calculate the equilibrium, introduce a price floor, and determine the resulting welfare loss—step by step.

### Step 1: Define the Market and Find Equilibrium
Consider a market for a good with the following demand and supply functions:

- **Demand**: $Q_d = 100 - P$ (quantity demanded decreases as price increases)
- **Supply**: $Q_s = P$ (quantity supplied equals the price, starting from zero)

To find the **equilibrium price and quantity**, set demand equal to supply:

$$100 - P = P$$

$$100 = 2P$$

$$P = 50$$

Now, substitute $P = 50$ into either equation:

$$Q = 50$$

So, the equilibrium is:

- **Price**: $P = 50$
- **Quantity**: $Q = 50$

### Step 2: Calculate Surplus at Equilibrium
At equilibrium, we calculate **consumer surplus (CS)** and **producer surplus (PS)** to find the total welfare.

- **Consumer Surplus**: The area above the price ($P = 50$) and below the demand curve up to $Q = 50$. The demand curve intersects the y-axis at $P = 100$ (when $Q = 0$), forming a triangle.

  $$CS = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 \times (100 - 50) = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 \times 50 = 1250$$

- **Producer Surplus**: The area below the price ($P = 50$) and above the supply curve up to $Q = 50$. The supply curve starts at $P = 0$ when $Q = 0$, forming a triangle.

  $$PS = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 \times 50 = 1250$$

- **Total Surplus (TS)**:

  $$TS = CS + PS = 1250 + 1250 = 2500$$

At equilibrium, the market maximizes welfare with a total surplus of 2500.

### Step 3: Introduce a Price Floor
Now, suppose the government sets a **price floor** at $P = 60$, above the equilibrium price of 50. A price floor prevents the price from falling below 60, affecting the quantity traded.

- **Quantity Demanded** at $P = 60$:

  $$Q_d = 100 - 60 = 40$$

- **Quantity Supplied** at $P = 60$:

  $$Q_s = 60$$

Since the price cannot adjust to equate supply and demand, a surplus occurs (60 supplied vs. 40 demanded). The **quantity traded** is limited by demand, so only 40 units are sold.

### Step 4: Calculate Surplus with the Price Floor
With the price floor at 60 and quantity at 40, recalculate the surpluses:

- **Consumer Surplus**: Consumers pay 60 for 40 units. The willingness to pay ranges from 100 (at $Q = 0$) to 60 (at $Q = 40$) along the demand curve. CS is the triangular area above $P = 60$ up to the demand curve:

  $$CS = \frac{1}{2} \times (100 - 60) \times 40 = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 \times 40 = 800$$

- **Producer Surplus**: Producers sell 40 units at 60 each. The supply curve ($P = Q$) shows their marginal cost ranges from 0 to 40 for those units. PS is the area above the supply curve and below the price:

  Total revenue = $60 \times 40 = 2400$

  Total cost = area under the supply curve from $Q = 0$ to 40:

  $$\int_0^{40} Q \, dQ = \left[ \frac{1}{2} Q^2 \right]_0^{40} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40^2 = 800$$

  $$PS = 2400 - 800 = 1600$$

  Alternatively, geometrically: PS is a trapezoid (or rectangle plus triangle):

  $$PS = \int_0^{40} (60 - Q) \, dQ = \left[ 60Q - \frac{1}{2} Q^2 \right]_0^{40} = (60 \times 40) - \frac{1}{2} \times 40^2 = 2400 - 800 = 1600$$

- **Total Surplus** with the price floor:

  $$TS = CS + PS = 800 + 1600 = 2400$$

### Step 5: Calculate Welfare Loss
The **welfare loss** is the reduction in total surplus due to the price floor:

$$\text{Welfare Loss} = TS_{\text{equilibrium}} - TS_{\text{price floor}} = 2500 - 2400 = 100$$

Alternatively, compute the **deadweight loss (DWL)** directly as the area of the triangle between the demand and supply curves from $Q = 40$ to $Q = 50$:

- At $Q = 40$:
  - Demand price: $P_d = 100 - 40 = 60$
  - Supply price (marginal cost): $P_s = 40$

- At $Q = 50$:
  - $P_d = P_s = 50$ (equilibrium point)

DWL is the triangle with base $50 - 40 = 10$ and height $60 - 40 = 20$ at $Q = 40$, tapering to zero at $Q = 50$:

$$DWL = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 20 = 100$$

This matches our welfare loss calculation, confirming consistency.

### Summary
- **Equilibrium**: $P = 50$, $Q = 50$, $CS = 1250$, $PS = 1250$, $TS = 2500$
- **Price Floor at $P = 60$**: $Q = 40$, $CS = 800$, $PS = 1600$, $TS = 2400$
- **Welfare Loss**: $2500 - 2400 = 100$, or DWL triangle = 100

This example shows that the price floor reduces the quantity traded from 50 to 40, creating a deadweight loss of 100—the value of the lost transactions where willingness to pay exceeded marginal cost. It’s a clear illustration of how price floors distort markets and reduce overall welfare!
