No, in a monopoly, $Q_{\text{supply}} \neq Q_{\text{demand}}$ at the market price. The monopolist sets the quantity supplied where marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC), not where supply equals demand like in a competitive market.

From the problem:
- The monopolist sets $Q = 4,000$ (calculated where $MR = MC$).[[SS25/PoE_Retake/5/MC = AC in Monopoly (SS25-PoE_Retake-5)#Step 1 Calculate Marginal Revenue MR]]
- At $Q = 4,000$, the price is $p = 6$ (from the demand curve $p = 10 - \frac{Q}{1,000}$).
- The quantity demanded at $p = 6$ is indeed $Q = 4,000$ (from $Q^D(p) = 10,000 - 1,000 \cdot 6$), which matches the quantity supplied—**but this is by design**. The monopolist chooses this quantity to maximize profit, and the price adjusts along the demand curve to clear that quantity.

So, while the quantities align at the monopolist’s chosen price, the monopolist isn’t setting $Q_{\text{supply}} = Q_{\text{demand}}$ directly; they’re setting $Q$ where $MR = MC$, and the demand curve determines the price at which that quantity is demanded. In a competitive market, $Q_{\text{supply}} = Q_{\text{demand}}$ at the equilibrium price, but a monopolist restricts output to raise the price above the competitive level.
