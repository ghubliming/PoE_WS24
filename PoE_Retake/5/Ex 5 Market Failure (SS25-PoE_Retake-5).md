# P2-4 Monopoly

[[MC = AC in Monopoly (SS25-PoE_Retake-5)]]

We need new formula for WL here since we do not have the Demand and Supply Curve

- PS is $p^{M}$ → [[SS25/PoE_Retake/5/(P2-4 Monopoly--Ex 5 Market Failure) (SS25-PoE_Retake-5)#^ns1mwo]]

# P5-8 External Effects
This is a hard one

[[(P5-8 External Effects--Ex 5 Market Failure) (SS25-PoE_Retake-5)]]

Note: 
For Equilibrium:
1. cal each companys p = MC(q)
2. Q_S = sum of 2 companys q
3. Let Q_S = Q_D → get exact p
4. cal the profit each company with p and q

The MB - MC is the benefit! So we cal the space between MB and MC
