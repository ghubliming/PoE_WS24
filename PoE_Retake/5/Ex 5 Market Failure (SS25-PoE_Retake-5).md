# P1 Monopoly
Compute $p(Q)$ from $Q^{D}$. And get $R(Q)$(times Q from p(Q), $\pi = R(Q) - C(Q)$), tax minus to cost function,(1-t) to profit function

- ![[$Q^{D}$ (SS25-PoE_Retake-5)]]

# P2-4 Monopoly
same with P1, but the *WL* and the price ceiling is hard and different to Ex4
and need to cal the *CS, PS*
$$CS = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Quantity} \times (\text{Max Price} - \text{Actual Price})$$
PS is profit

[[(P2-4 Monopoly--Ex 5 Market Failure) (SS25-PoE_Retake-5)]]

[[MC = AC in Monopoly (SS25-PoE_Retake-5)]]

We need new formula for WL here since we do not have the Demand and Supply Curve

- PS is $p^{M}$ → [[SS25/PoE_Retake/5/(P2-4 Monopoly--Ex 5 Market Failure) (SS25-PoE_Retake-5)#^ns1mwo]]

# P5-8 External Effects
This is a hard one
individual profit vs combined profit

[[(P5-8 External Effects--Ex 5 Market Failure) (SS25-PoE_Retake-5)]]

Note: 
For Equilibrium:
1. cal each companies p = MC(q)
2. Q_S = sum of 2 companies q
3. Let Q_S = Q_D → get exact p
4. cal the profit each company with p and q

# P9-10 Public Goods

[[(P9-10 Public Goods--Ex 5 Market Failure) (SS25-PoE_Retake-5)]]

[[Public Goods (SS25-PoE_Retake-5)]]
The MB - MC is the benefit! So we cal the space between MB and MC
