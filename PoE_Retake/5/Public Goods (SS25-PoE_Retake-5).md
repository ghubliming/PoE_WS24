## What Are Public Goods?

Public goods are defined by two key characteristics:

1. **Non-excludability**: It's difficult or impossible to prevent non-payers from using the good
2. **Non-rivalry**: One person's use doesn't reduce availability for others
1。**不可取性**：阻止非付款人使用good是困难或不可能的
2。**非竞争**：一个人的使用并不能减少其他人的可用性

Examples include national defense, street lighting, clean air, and public parks.

## The Market Failure with Public Goods

This problem illustrates the classic market failure associated with public goods:

1. **The Free-Rider Problem**: Since individuals cannot be excluded from enjoying the benefits, they have an incentive to "free ride" - enjoying the benefits without contributing to the cost. This leads to:
    
    - Individuals not revealing their true willingness to pay
    - Private market underprovision (or no provision) of the good
2. **Inefficient Market Outcome**: ==In the problem, the market equilibrium is a corner solution (Q=0) - the good isn't provided at all, even though society would benefit from having some positive quantity.==
    
3. **Social vs. Private Benefits**:
    
    - The private marginal benefit (MB) for each individual is too small to justify providing the good
    - But the social marginal benefit (5·MB for 5 individuals) exceeds the marginal cost, indicating society should produce the good
**社会与私人福利**：
    
     - 每个人的私人边际收益（MB）太小，无法证明提供良好的合理性
     - 但是社会边缘利益（5个人的5·MB）超过了边际成本，表明社会应产生善良

## The Welfare Loss Formula's Significance

The welfare loss formula quantifies the cost of this market failure. It measures the total net benefits that society loses when the public good isn't provided at the optimal level.

The problem demonstrates why government intervention (through direct provision or subsidies) is often necessary for public goods - the market alone fails to provide the socially optimal quantity, resulting in measurable welfare losses to society.
