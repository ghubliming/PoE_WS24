>[!tip] REMEMBER the formula


the welfare loss (WL) formula is designed to measure the social inefficiency that occurs when firms don't internalize the externality.

The formula looks like: WL = 1/2 · (MC_ex(Q*)) · (Q_1 - Q_2)

Let me explain why this formula is structured this way:

1. __MC_ex(Q_)**: This represents the marginal external cost at the private equilibrium quantity Q_. It's the cost that each firm imposes on the other firm but doesn't account for in its individual decision-making. In this case, MC_ex(Q*) = 1/5.
    
2. **Q_1 - Q_2**: This is the difference between the individual profit-maximizing quantity (Q_1 = 100) and the socially optimal quantity (Q_2 = 90). It represents the "excess" production that occurs when firms don't account for the externality.
    
3. **The 1/2 factor**: This reflects the triangular shape of the welfare loss area. Since marginal costs increase linearly, the welfare loss forms a triangle, and the area of a triangle is (1/2) · base · height.
    

The formula uses MC_ex(Q*) because:

- ==The externality is the source of the welfare loss==
- At each unit between Q_2 and Q_1, the social marginal cost exceeds the private marginal cost by the amount of the externality
- The average height of this welfare loss triangle is MC_ex(Q*)

In essence, the formula calculates the area of the deadweight loss triangle caused by overproduction when firms ignore the external effects of their production. Each unit produced beyond the socially optimal level creates a net social loss, and the formula captures the cumulative effect of this inefficiency.

For a more general formula for welfare loss due to externalities, we can consider both positive and negative externalities in different contexts:

**General Welfare Loss Formula:** WL = 1/2 · |MEC or MEB| · |Q_market - Q_efficient|

Where:

- MEC = Marginal External Cost (for negative externalities)
- ~~MEB = Marginal External Benefit (for positive externalities)~~
- Q_market = Quantity produced in private market equilibrium
- Q_efficient = Socially optimal quantity

This generalized formula works for:

1. **Negative externalities** (like pollution): WL = 1/2 · MEC · (Q_market - Q_efficient) _where Q_market > Q_efficient_
    
2. **Positive externalities** (like education): WL = 1/2 · MEB · (Q_efficient - Q_market) _where Q_efficient > Q_market_
    

The welfare loss is always the triangular area representing the difference between social and private equilibrium outcomes, with the height being the marginal external effect at the relevant quantity.
