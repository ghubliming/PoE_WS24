The general formula for welfare loss in public goods contexts (not limited to the corner solution) would be:

$$WL = \int_{Q_{actual}}^{Q_{opt}} [MB_{social}(Q) - MC(Q)] dQ$$

Where:

- $Q_{actual}$ is the quantity actually provided (could be the market equilibrium quantity)
- $Q_{opt}$ is the socially optimal quantity
- $MB_{social}(Q)$ is the social marginal benefit function (sum of individual marginal benefits)
- $MC(Q)$ is the marginal cost function

This integral represents the area between the social marginal benefit curve and the marginal cost curve, from the actual quantity to the optimal quantity, which measures the deadweight loss from under-provision of the public good.

I was indeed giving you the specific formula applied to the corner solution in the exercise, not the general case.
