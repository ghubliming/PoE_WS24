In Problem 6, we recognize the collective welfare maximum because the firms are internalizing the externality in their decision-making process.

Here's why this is a welfare maximum:

1. **Internalizing the Externality**: In the individual profit maximization case (Problem 5), each firm ignores the cost it imposes on the other firm. However, in Problem 6, the firms collectively maximize total profit, meaning they account for how each firm's output affects the other's costs.
    
2. **Social Marginal Cost vs. Private Marginal Cost**:
    
    - In Problem 5, firms only consider their private marginal cost (MC = 1/50 q_i)
    - In Problem 6, firms consider the full social marginal cost (MC = 1/50 q_i + 1/5), which includes the external cost (1/5) that each unit of production imposes on the other firm
3. **Optimal Output Level**: When firms account for the full social cost of production, the market equilibrium quantity (90) is less than the individual profit-maximizing quantity (100). This reduction in output is welfare-improving because for those last 10 units, the social cost of producing them exceeds their social benefit.
    
4. ==**Alignment with Economic Theory**: Economic theory tells us that welfare is maximized when social marginal benefit equals social marginal cost. By internalizing the externality, the firms are achieving precisely this condition.==
    

This is why Problem 6 represents the welfare maximum - it's the socially optimal allocation that maximizes total surplus by accounting for all costs, both private and external.
