### Sector 2: Problems 5–6 (Unemployment)

#### Question Analysis
**What the Questions are Asking:**
Problems 5 and 6 involve calculating labor market indicators for an economy with an adult population of $N = 70$ million and 2.1 million unemployed individuals ($U = 2.1$ million). Specifically:
- **Problem 5:** Given a labor force participation rate of $e = 0.5$, calculate the number of employed people ($E$) and select the correct multiple-choice option.
- **Problem 6:** Given an unemployment rate of $u = 0.05$, calculate the labor force participation rate ($e$) and select the correct option.

**Key Components:**
1. **Labor Force Participation Rate ($e$):**
   - Defined as the fraction of the adult population in the labor force:
     $$
     e = \frac{L}{N} = \frac{E + U}{N}
$$
     where $L$ is the labor force (employed $E$ plus unemployed $U$), and $N$ is the adult population.
2. **Unemployment Rate ($u$):**
   - Defined as the fraction of the labor force that is unemployed:
     $$
     u = \frac{U}{L} = \frac{U}{E + U}
$$
3. **Data Provided:**
   - Adult population: $N = 70$ million.
   - Unemployed: $U = 2.1$ million.
   - **Problem 5:** Labor force participation rate $e = 0.5$.
   - **Problem 6:** Unemployment rate $u = 0.05$.
4. **Multiple-Choice Options:**
   - **Problem 5:** (A) $E = 32.9$ million, (B) $E = 33.4$ million, (C) $E = 33.9$ million, (D) $E = 34.4$ million.
   - **Problem 6:** (A) $e = 0.4$, (B) $e = 0.5$, (C) $e = 0.6$, (D) $e = 0.7$.

#### Step-by-Step Solution Explanation

##### Problem 5: Number of Employed People ($E$)
**Question Breakdown:**
- Given $N = 70$ million, $U = 2.1$ million, and $e = 0.5$, find the number of employed people ($E$).
- Select the correct option from the provided choices.

**Step 1: Derive the Labor Force ($L$)**
- **Explanation of Reasoning:** The labor force participation rate is the ratio of the labor force to the adult population. We use the formula $e = \frac{L}{N}$ to find the labor force ($L$), which will help us determine the number of employed people later.
- **Methods and Concepts:**
  - **Labor Force Participation Rate Formula:** $e = \frac{L}{N}$.
  - **Labor Force:** $L = E + U$, the sum of employed and unemployed individuals.
- **Assumptions and Definitions:**
  - **Assumption:** The population and unemployment figures are in millions, and all values are for the same time period (unspecified but assumed consistent).
  - **Definitions:**
    - $N$: Total adult population (70 million).
    - $L$: Labor force (to be calculated).
    - $e$: Labor force participation rate (0.5, or 50%).
- **Calculation:**
  $$
  e = \frac{L}{N} \implies L = e \cdot N
$$
  $$
  L = 0.5 \cdot 70 = 35 \text{ million}
$$
  - **Result:** The labor force is 35 million people.

**Step 2: Calculate the Number of Employed People ($E$)**
- **Explanation of Reasoning:** The labor force consists of employed ($E$) and unemployed ($U$) individuals. Since $L = E + U$, we can rearrange to solve for $E$:
  $$
  E = L - U
$$
  We use the labor force from Step 1 and the given number of unemployed to find $E$.
- **Methods and Concepts:**
  - **Labor Force Composition:** The labor force is the sum of those working ($E$) and those seeking work but unemployed ($U$).
- **Assumptions and Definitions:**
  - **Assumption:** The unemployed figure (2.1 million) is accurate and consistent with the labor force.
  - **Definitions:**
    - $U$: Unemployed individuals (2.1 million).
    - $E$: Employed individuals (to be calculated).
- **Calculation:**
  $$
  E = L - U = 35 - 2.1 = 32.9 \text{ million}
$$
  - **Result:** The number of employed people is 32.9 million.

**Step 3: Verify with Multiple-Choice Options**
- **Explanation of Reasoning:** Compare the calculated $E = 32.9$ million with the options to select the correct one.
- **Options:**
  - (A) $E = 32.9$ million
  - (B) $E = 33.4$ million
  - (C) $E = 33.9$ million
  - (D) $E = 34.4$ million
- **Result:** The calculated value matches option (A), so **(A) $E = 32.9$ million** is correct.

**Alternative Derivation (Direct Formula):**
- The solution PDF derives $E$ directly from the labor force participation rate formula:
  $$
  e = \frac{E + U}{N} \implies E + U = e \cdot N \implies E = e \cdot N - U
$$
- Substitute:
  $$
  E = 0.5 \cdot 70 - 2.1 = 35 - 2.1 = 32.9 \text{ million}
$$
- This confirms the result, showing consistency between approaches.

##### Problem 6: Labor Force Participation Rate ($e$)
**Question Breakdown:**
- Given $N = 70$ million, $U = 2.1$ million, and an unemployment rate $u = 0.05$, calculate the labor force participation rate ($e$).
- Select the correct option from the provided choices.

**Step 1: Calculate the Labor Force ($L$)**
- **Explanation of Reasoning:** The unemployment rate is the fraction of the labor force that is unemployed ($u = \frac{U}{L}$). We rearrange this to find the labor force ($L$), which is needed to compute the labor force participation rate.
- **Methods and Concepts:**
  - **Unemployment Rate Formula:** $u = \frac{U}{L}$.
  - **Labor Force:** $L = E + U$.
- **Assumptions and Definitions:**
  - **Assumption:** The unemployment rate (0.05, or 5%) and unemployed figure (2.1 million) are consistent.
  - **Definitions:**
    - $U$: Unemployed (2.1 million).
    - $u$: Unemployment rate (0.05).
    - $L$: Labor force (to be calculated).
- **Calculation:**
  $$
  u = \frac{U}{L} \implies L = \frac{U}{u}
$$
  $$
  L = \frac{2.1}{0.05} = 42 \text{ million}
$$
  - **Result:** The labor force is 42 million people.

**Step 2: Calculate the Labor Force Participation Rate ($e$)**
- **Explanation of Reasoning:** With the labor force ($L$) and adult population ($N$) known, we use the labor force participation rate formula $e = \frac{L}{N}$ to find $e$.
- **Methods and Concepts:**
  - **Labor Force Participation Rate Formula:** Measures the proportion of the adult population that is either employed or actively seeking work.
- **Assumptions and Definitions:**
  - **Assumption:** The adult population (70 million) includes all individuals eligible for the labor force.
  - **Definitions:**
    - $L$: Labor force (42 million).
    - $N$: Adult population (70 million).
    - $e$: Labor force participation rate (to be calculated).
- **Calculation:**
  $$
  e = \frac{L}{N} = \frac{42}{70} = 0.6
$$
  - **Result:** The labor force participation rate is 0.6 (or 60%).

**Step 3: Verify with Multiple-Choice Options**
- **Explanation of Reasoning:** Compare the calculated $e = 0.6$ with the options to select the correct one.
- **Options:**
  - (A) $e = 0.4$
  - (B) $e = 0.5$
  - (C) $e = 0.6$
  - (D) $e = 0.7$
- **Result:** The calculated value matches option (C), so **(C) $e = 0.6$** is correct.

**Additional Verification:**
- To ensure consistency, calculate $E$ using $L = E + U$:
  $$
  E = L - U = 42 - 2.1 = 39.9 \text{ million}
$$
- Check the unemployment rate:
  $$
  u = \frac{U}{E + U} = \frac{2.1}{39.9 + 2.1} = \frac{2.1}{42} = 0.05
$$
- This confirms the labor force calculation aligns with the given unemployment rate.

#### Overall Summary for Problems 5–6
Problems 5 and 6 assess understanding of unemployment metrics in an economy with an adult population of 70 million and 2.1 million unemployed. **Problem 5** uses the labor force participation rate ($e = 0.5$) to find the labor force ($L = 35$ million) and then calculates the employed ($E = 35 - 2.1 = 32.9$ million), selecting option (A). **Problem 6** uses the unemployment rate ($u = 0.05$) to find the labor force ($L = 2.1 / 0.05 = 42$ million) and then calculates the participation rate ($e = 42 / 70 = 0.6$), selecting option (C). The solutions rely on standard labor market formulas, assuming consistent data in millions and no additional factors (e.g., discouraged workers). The calculations are straightforward and correct, with results verified against the options and alternative derivations.

**Final Answers:**
- **Problem 5:** (A) $E = 32.9$ million
- **Problem 6:** (C) $e = 0.6$
