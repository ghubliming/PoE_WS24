# How CPI is Calculated

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is calculated through these key steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Economists survey thousands of retail stores, service establishments, and housing units to gather price data on a representative "basket" of goods and services.

2. **Item Selection**: This basket includes around 80,000 items grouped into categories (food, housing, transportation, healthcare, etc.) that represent typical consumer spending.

3. **Weighting**: Each category is assigned a weight based on its importance in the average consumer's budget (housing typically has the largest weight).

4. **Calculation**: 
   - Prices are compared to a base period (set at 100)
   - The weighted average price changes are calculated
   - The index is expressed as a percentage of the base period

5. **Regular Updates**: The basket composition is periodically updated to reflect changing consumer habits.

The final CPI number shows how much prices have changed compared to the base period, serving as the primary gauge of inflation.
