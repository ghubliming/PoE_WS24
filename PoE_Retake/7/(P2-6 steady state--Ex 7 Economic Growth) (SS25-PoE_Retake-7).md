### Problem 2: In the steady state, output per worker is $y^* = 1$ if the saving rate is...

**What the Question is Asking:**  
We need to find the saving rate $s$ that results in a steady-state output per worker $y^* = 1$. The production function is $Y = L^{\frac{1}{3}} K^{\frac{2}{3}}$, labor grows at $n = \frac{1}{6}$, capital depreciates at $\delta = \frac{1}{6}$, and investment is $sY$. Options are: (A) $s = \frac{1}{12}$, (B) $s = \frac{1}{6}$, (C) $s = \frac{1}{3}$, (D) $s = \frac{2}{3}$.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

- **Step 1: Express Output Per Worker**  
  **Reasoning:** To work with per-worker quantities, convert the production function into per-worker terms using $k = \frac{K}{L}$.  
  **Methods:** $Y = L^{\frac{1}{3}} K^{\frac{2}{3}}$. Divide by $L$:  
  $$
  y = \frac{Y}{L} = L^{\frac{1}{3} - 1} K^{\frac{2}{3}} = L^{-\frac{2}{3}} (kL)^{\frac{2}{3}} = k^{\frac{2}{3}}.
$$  
  So, $y = k^{\frac{2}{3}}$.  
  **Assumptions:** The function has constant returns to scale.  
  **Definitions:** $y = \frac{Y}{L}$, $k = \frac{K}{L}$.

- **Step 2: Steady-State Condition for $k$**  
  **Reasoning:** In the steady state, $k$ is constant ($\dot{k} = 0$). Balance investment per worker against depreciation and labor growth.  
  **Methods:** Capital evolves as $\dot{K} = sY - \delta K$. Since $k = \frac{K}{L}$, compute $\dot{k}$:  
  $$
  \dot{k} = \frac{\dot{K}}{L} - k \frac{\dot{L}}{L}, \quad \dot{L}/L = n.
$$  
  Substitute $\dot{K}$:  
  $$
  \dot{k} = s \frac{Y}{L} - \delta k - n k = s k^{\frac{2}{3}} - (\delta + n) k.
$$  
  In steady state:  
  $$
  s (k^*)^{\frac{2}{3}} = (\delta + n) k^*.
$$  
  **Assumptions:** $k \neq 0$.  
  **Definitions:** $\delta + n = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$.

- **Step 3: Solve for $(k^*)^{\frac{2}{3}}$**  
  **Reasoning:** Solve the steady-state equation to express $k^*$ in terms of $s$.  
  **Methods:** Divide by $(k^*)^{\frac{2}{3}}$:  
  $$
  s = (\delta + n) (k^*)^{\frac{1}{3}}, \quad (k^*)^{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{s}{\delta + n} = \frac{s}{\frac{1}{3}} = 3s.
$$  
  Thus, $(k^*)^{\frac{2}{3}} = (3s)^2 = 9s^2$.  
  **Assumptions:** $k^* > 0$.  
  ==**Definitions:** $k^*$ is steady-state capital per worker.==

- **Step 4: Compute $y^*$**  
  **Reasoning:** Use the per-worker production function to find $y^*$.  
  **Methods:** $y^* = (k^*)^{\frac{2}{3}} = 9s^2$.  
  **Assumptions:** None new.  
  **Definitions:** $y^*$ is steady-state output per worker.

- **Step 5: Solve for $s$**  
  **Reasoning:** Set $y^* = 1$ and solve for $s$.  
  **Methods:**  
  $$
  1 = 9s^2 \implies s^2 = \frac{1}{9} \implies s = \frac{1}{3}.
$$  
  **Assumptions:** $s \in (0,1)$, so take the positive root.  
  **Definitions:** $s$ is the saving rate.

- **Step 6: Match with Options**  
  **Reasoning:** Compare $s = \frac{1}{3}$ with the options.  
  **Methods:** Option (C) is $s = \frac{1}{3}$.  
  **Assumptions:** Options are exhaustive.  
  **Definitions:** None new.

**Summary:** We derived $y = k^{\frac{2}{3}}$, found the steady-state condition $s (k^*)^{\frac{2}{3}} = (\delta + n) k^*$, solved for $(k^*)^{\frac{2}{3}} = 9s^2$, and thus $y^* = 9s^2$. Setting $y^* = 1$, we got $s = \frac{1}{3}$, matching option (C). The solution uses the Solow model’s steady-state framework, assuming constant returns and positive capital.

### Problem 3: Substituting the saving rate $s = \frac{1}{3}$ into equation (1) yields the steady-state capital stock per worker...

**What the Question is Asking:**  
Using $s = \frac{1}{3}$ (from Problem 2) and equation (1) $(k^*)^{\frac{2}{3}} = 9s^2$, find the steady-state capital per worker $k^*$. The solution suggests options, with (B) being correct, implying $k^* = 1$.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

- **Step 1: Use Equation (1)**  
  **Reasoning:** Equation (1) relates $(k^*)^{\frac{2}{3}}$ to $s$. Substitute $s = \frac{1}{3}$.  
  **Methods:** From Problem 2, equation (1) is:  
  $$
  (k^*)^{\frac{2}{3}} = 9s^2.
$$  
  Substitute $s = \frac{1}{3}$:  
  $$
  (k^*)^{\frac{2}{3}} = 9 \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = 9 \cdot \frac{1}{9} = 1.
$$  
  **Assumptions:** $s = \frac{1}{3}$ from Problem 2.  
  **Definitions:** Equation (1) is $(k^*)^{\frac{2}{3}} = 9s^2$.

- **Step 2: Solve for $k^*$**  
  **Reasoning:** Compute $k^*$ from $(k^*)^{\frac{2}{3}}$.  
  **Methods:**  
  $$
  (k^*)^{\frac{2}{3}} = 1 \implies k^* = 1^{\frac{3}{2}} = 1.
$$  
  **Assumptions:** $k^* \geq 0$.  
  **Definitions:** None new.

- **Step 3: Interpret the Result**  
  **Reasoning:** With $k^* = 1$, per-worker quantities are constant, and aggregates grow at the labor growth rate $n = \frac{1}{6}$. This matches option (B).  
  **Methods:** No computation needed; it’s a conceptual check.  
  **Assumptions:** Steady state implies constant per-worker quantities.  
  **Definitions:** Aggregates like $K$, $Y$ grow at rate $n$.

**Summary:** Substituting $s = \frac{1}{3}$ into $(k^*)^{\frac{2}{3}} = 9s^2$, we get $(k^*)^{\frac{2}{3}} = 1$, so $k^* = 1$. In the steady state, per-worker quantities are constant, and aggregates grow at $n = \frac{1}{6}$, matching option (B). The solution relies on the steady-state relationship derived earlier, assuming the prior result for $s$.

### Problem 4: Substituting equation (3) into equation (1) yields the golden-rule saving rate...

**What the Question is Asking:**  
Find the golden-rule saving rate $s_{\text{gold}}$, which maximizes steady-state consumption per worker. Equation (3) is $k^*_{\text{gold}} = 8$, and equation (1) is $(k^*)^{\frac{2}{3}} = 9s^2$. The correct answer is (D) $s = \frac{2}{3}$.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

- **Step 1: Understand the Golden Rule**  
  **Reasoning:** The golden-rule capital stock maximizes consumption per worker, where the marginal product of capital equals $\delta + n$.  
  **Methods:** The marginal product of $k$ is:  
  $$
  f(k) = k^{\frac{2}{3}}, \quad f'(k) = \frac{2}{3} k^{-\frac{1}{3}}.
$$  
  Golden-rule condition: $f'(k_{\text{gold}}) = \delta + n$.  
  $$
  \frac{2}{3} (k_{\text{gold}})^{-\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{1}{3} \implies (k_{\text{gold}})^{-\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{1}{2} \implies (k_{\text{gold}})^{\frac{1}{3}} = 2 \implies k_{\text{gold}} = 8.
$$  
  This is equation (3).  
  **Assumptions:** $k_{\text{gold}} > 0$.  
  **Definitions:** Golden-rule level maximizes $c^* = y^* - s y^*$.

- **Step 2: Substitute into Equation (1)**  
  **Reasoning:** Use $k^*_{\text{gold}} = 8$ in equation (1) to find $s_{\text{gold}}$.  
  **Methods:**  
  $$
  (k^*)^{\frac{2}{3}} = 9s^2 \implies (8)^{\frac{2}{3}} = 9 s_{\text{gold}}^2.
$$  
  Since $8^{\frac{1}{3}} = 2$, $(8)^{\frac{2}{3}} = 4$:  
  $$
  4 = 9 s_{\text{gold}}^2 \implies s_{\text{gold}}^2 = \frac{4}{9} \implies s_{\text{gold}} = \frac{2}{3}.
$$  
  **Assumptions:** $s \in (0,1)$.  
  **Definitions:** $s_{\text{gold}}$ is the golden-rule saving rate.

- **Step 3: Match with Options**  
  **Reasoning:** Compare with options.  
  **Methods:** Option (D) is $s = \frac{2}{3}$.  
  **Assumptions:** None new.  
  **Definitions:** None new.

**Summary:** The golden-rule $k_{\text{gold}} = 8$ (equation 3) was substituted into $(k^*)^{\frac{2}{3}} = 9s^2$ (equation 1), yielding $s_{\text{gold}} = \frac{2}{3}$, matching option (D). The golden-rule condition $f'(k) = \delta + n$ defines $k_{\text{gold}}$, and the solution assumes positive capital and a valid saving rate.

### Problem 5: Substituting $s_{\text{gold}} = \frac{2}{3}$ into equation (2) yields output per worker in the golden-rule steady state...

**What the Question is Asking:**  
Using $s_{\text{gold}} = \frac{2}{3}$ and equation (2) $y^* = 9s^2$, find the golden-rule output per worker $y^*_{\text{gold}}$, and compute consumption per worker. The correct answer is (C) $c^*_{\text{gold}} = \frac{4}{3}$.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

- **Step 1: Compute $y^*_{\text{gold}}$**  
  **Reasoning:** Use equation (2) to find output per worker at the golden-rule saving rate.  
  **Methods:** Equation (2): $y^* = 9s^2$. Substitute $s = \frac{2}{3}$:  
  $$
  y^*_{\text{gold}} = 9 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = 9 \cdot \frac{4}{9} = 4.
$$  
  **Assumptions:** $s_{\text{gold}} = \frac{2}{3}$ from Problem 4.  
  **Definitions:** Equation (2) is $y^* = 9s^2$.

- **Step 2: Compute Consumption Per Worker**  
  **Reasoning:** Consumption is output minus savings: $c^* = (1 - s) y^*$.  
  **Methods:**  
  $$
  c^*_{\text{gold}} = (1 - s_{\text{gold}}) y^*_{\text{gold}} = \left(1 - \frac{2}{3}\right) \cdot 4 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 4 = \frac{4}{3}.
$$  
  **Assumptions:** All output is either consumed or saved.  
  **Definitions:** $c^* = (1 - s) y^*$.

- **Step 3: Match with Options**  
  **Reasoning:** The problem asks for consumption, and $\frac{4}{3}$ matches option (C).  
  **Methods:** Direct comparison.  
  **Assumptions:** None new.  
  **Definitions:** None new.

**Summary:** Using $s_{\text{gold}} = \frac{2}{3}$ in $y^* = 9s^2$, we found $y^*_{\text{gold}} = 4$. Consumption is $c^*_{\text{gold}} = (1 - \frac{2}{3}) \cdot 4 = \frac{4}{3}$, matching option (C). The solution assumes output splits between consumption and savings, using prior results.

### Problem 6: Any saving rate satisfying $s \in [0, \frac{1}{3})$ is strictly below the golden-rule saving rate...

**What the Question is Asking:**  
Determine if $s \in [0, \frac{1}{3})$ (below $s = \frac{1}{3}$) is less than the golden-rule saving rate $s_{\text{gold}} = \frac{2}{3}$, implying[[dynamic inefficiency (SS25-PoE_Retake-7)]]. The correct answer is (A).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

- **Step 1: Compare Saving Rates**  
  **Reasoning:** Check if $s < \frac{1}{3}$ is below $s_{\text{gold}}$.  
  **Methods:** From Problem 4, $s_{\text{gold}} = \frac{2}{3}$. Since $\frac{1}{3} < \frac{2}{3}$, any $s \in [0, \frac{1}{3})$ satisfies $s < s_{\text{gold}}$.  
  **Assumptions:** $s_{\text{gold}} = \frac{2}{3}$.  
  **Definitions:** None new.

- **Step 2: Dynamic Inefficiency**  
  **Reasoning:** A saving rate below the golden-rule level means overconsumption, reducing future capital and output, which is dynamically inefficient.  
**推理：**低于黄金规则水平的储蓄率意味着过度消费，减少了未来的资本和产出，这在动态上效率低下。
  **Methods:** In the Solow model, $s < s_{\text{gold}}$ implies $k^* < k_{\text{gold}}$, leading to lower steady-state consumption than possible.  
  **Assumptions:** The economy can adjust $s$.  
  **Definitions:** Dynamic inefficiency means a feasible path exists with higher consumption.

- **Step 3: Match with Options**  
  **Reasoning:** Option (A) states this implication, which is true.  
  **Methods:** Conceptual confirmation.  
  **Assumptions:** None new.  
  **Definitions:** None new.

**Summary:** Since $s \in [0, \frac{1}{3}) < \frac{1}{3} < s_{\text{gold}} = \frac{2}{3}$, such saving rates are below the golden-rule level, leading to dynamic inefficiency by overconsuming today at the expense of future generations. This matches option (A), using Solow model principles and prior results.
