# P1 steady state
now we have new Eq. $Y = F(L,K)$, need to know the steady state Eq. and Golden Rule
a) is about saving rate per worker, get the function related to *capital per worker k*
b) is about the *Steady State* and consumption per worker, which need get the $y*$ and $c = (1-s)y*$ ~ s
c) is Golden Rule → max the $c^{*}(s)$

~~Tough Exercise!~~

new golden rule condition [[SS25/PoE_Retake/7/(P2-6 steady state--Ex 7 Economic Growth) (SS25-PoE_Retake-7)#^lp8sj4]] 
- derivative of $f^{*} = \delta + n$ → get *k^gold* → into steady state → get *s^gold*
- if undersaving i.e. s < gold→ we are *dynamic efficient*
