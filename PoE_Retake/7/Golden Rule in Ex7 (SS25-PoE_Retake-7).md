# Understanding the Golden Rule and Dynamic Inefficiency

This note provides a detailed explanation of the Golden Rule of capital accumulation and its relationship to dynamic inefficiency. We will reconcile two common methods for finding the Golden Rule saving rate and clarify the underlying economic intuition.

### The Core Concept: Maximizing Consumption

In economic growth models, the "Golden Rule" level of capital is the steady-state capital stock per worker ($k^*$) that maximizes consumption per worker ($c^*$). The corresponding saving rate ($s$) that achieves this is called the **Golden Rule saving rate ($s_{\text{gold}}$)**.

The fundamental trade-off is this:
- **Saving more today** means more investment, a higher future capital stock, and thus higher future output.
- **Saving less today** means more consumption now, but at the cost of lower future output and consumption.

The Golden Rule finds the "sweet spot" that gives the highest possible sustainable level of consumption in the long run.

### Two Paths to the Golden Rule

Your notes highlight two different but equivalent ways to find the Golden Rule saving rate.

#### Method 1: Maximizing the Consumption Function (The Direct Approach)

This method involves three steps:
1.  **Express steady-state consumption per worker ($c^*$) as a function of the saving rate ($s$).**
    - From your first note, we had $c^*(s) = 20s - 20s^2$. This was derived from the steady-state condition $s f(k^*) = (\delta + n) k^*$ and the identity $c^* = (1-s)y^*$.
2.  **Take the derivative of $c^*(s)$ with respect to $s$.**
    - $\frac{d c^*(s)}{ds} = 20 - 40s$
3.  **Set the derivative to zero and solve for $s$.**
    - $20 - 40s = 0 \implies s_{\text{gold}} = \frac{1}{2}$

This approach is intuitive because it directly tackles the optimization problem: find the $s$ that maximizes $c^*$.

#### Method 2: The Marginal Product of Capital Condition (The Indirect, but Powerful, Approach)

This method uses a more general condition for the Golden Rule, which is that the **marginal product of capital (MPK)** must equal the sum of the depreciation rate ($\delta$) and the population growth rate ($n$).

**Golden Rule Condition:** $f'(k_{\text{gold}}) = \delta + n$

Where:
- $f'(k)$ is the first derivative of the per-worker production function, which represents the MPK.
- $k_{\text{gold}}$ is the Golden Rule level of capital per worker.

**Why does this work?**
In the steady state, consumption is the difference between output and investment:
$c^* = f(k^*) - i^*$

Since steady-state investment must cover capital depreciation and dilution from population growth, $i^* = (\delta + n)k^*$. So:
$c^* = f(k^*) - (\delta + n)k^*$

To maximize $c^*$ with respect to $k^*$, we take the derivative and set it to zero:
$\frac{d c^*}{d k^*} = f'(k^*) - (\delta + n) = 0$
$\implies f'(k^*) = \delta + n$

This condition tells us that at the Golden Rule level, the extra output from the last unit of capital ($f'(k^*)$) is just enough to cover its depreciation and provide capital for new workers. Any more capital, and the cost of maintaining it would exceed the output it generates, reducing consumption.

### Why Are the Two Methods the Same Thing?

Fundamentally, the two methods are equivalent. They are different mathematical approaches to finding the exact same economic point: the peak of the steady-state consumption curve.

1.  **They Optimize the Same Goal:** Both methods are designed to find the conditions that maximize steady-state consumption per worker ($c^*$).

2.  **They Use Different Variables for the Same Problem:**
    *   **Method 1 (Maximizing $c^*(s)$)** treats the **saving rate ($s$)** as the primary variable. It asks: "Which saving rate gives the highest possible long-run consumption?"
    *   **Method 2 (Using $f'(k) = \delta + n$)** treats the **capital stock ($k$)** as the primary variable. It asks: "What is the optimal level of capital, where the gap between output $f(k)$ and the investment needed to maintain it, $(\delta+n)k$, is largest?"

3.  **The Link is the Steady-State Condition:** The saving rate ($s$) and the steady-state capital stock ($k^*$) are not independent. The equation $s f(k^*) = (\delta + n) k^*$ rigidly links them. Choosing a specific $s$ determines a specific $k^*$, and vice-versa.

Think of it like finding the highest point on a hill. Method 1 is like finding the latitude of the peak, while Method 2 is like finding the longitude. Since there is only one peak, the latitude and longitude you find must describe the exact same location. The steady-state equation is the map that shows how to get from the latitude to the longitude.

### Reconciling the Two Methods: The Cobb-Douglas Case

The second note uses a shortcut available for the **Cobb-Douglas production function**: $Y = K^\alpha L^{1-\alpha}$.
In per-worker terms, this is $y = f(k) = k^\alpha$.

For this specific function, it can be shown that the Golden Rule saving rate is simply equal to the capital share, $\alpha$.

**Derivation:**
1.  **Find the MPK:** $f'(k) = \alpha k^{\alpha - 1}$
2.  **Apply the Golden Rule condition:** $\alpha (k_{\text{gold}})^{\alpha - 1} = \delta + n$
3.  **From the general steady-state condition:** $s f(k^*) = (\delta + n) k^* \implies s (k^*)^\alpha = (\delta + n) k^*$
    - This simplifies to $s (k^*) ^{\alpha-1} = \delta + n$.
4.  **Compare the two equations:**
    - At the Golden Rule steady state, both conditions must hold:
      - $\alpha (k_{\text{gold}})^{\alpha - 1} = \delta + n$
      - $s_{\text{gold}} (k_{\text{gold}})^{\alpha - 1} = \delta + n$
    - From this, it is clear that **$s_{\text{gold}} = \alpha$**.

This is why the second note could directly state that for $Y = L^{\frac{1}{3}} K^{\frac{2}{3}}$ (where $\alpha = 2/3$), the Golden Rule saving rate is $s_{\text{gold}} = 2/3$.

### Dynamic Efficiency vs. Inefficiency

This concept relates an economy's actual saving rate ($s$) to the Golden Rule saving rate ($s_{\text{gold}}$).

-   **Dynamically Efficient ($s < s_{\text{gold}}$):**
    The economy is saving *less* than the amount that would maximize long-run consumption. To increase consumption in the future, the current generation must make a sacrifice by consuming less and saving more. There is no "free lunch." This is the situation for most real-world economies.

-   **Dynamically Inefficient ($s > s_{\text{gold}}$):**
    The economy is "over-saving." It has accumulated so much capital that the marginal product of capital is very low. By simply *reducing* the saving rate, the economy could increase consumption not only in the present but in the future as well. This is a "free lunch" scenario because all generations can be made better off.

**Conclusion from your notes:**
In Problem 6, the saving rate was $s < 1/3$, and the Golden Rule rate was $s_{\text{gold}} = 2/3$. Since $s < s_{\text{gold}}$, the economy is **dynamically efficient**.
