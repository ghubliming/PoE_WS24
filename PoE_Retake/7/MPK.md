# Marginal Product of Capital (MPK)

The Marginal Product of Capital (MPK) is a fundamental concept in economics and specifically in growth theory like the Solow model.

## Definition
- MPK refers to the additional output produced by one additional unit of capital, holding all other factors of production constant
- Mathematically, it's the derivative of the production function with respect to capital: MPK = ∂Y/∂K
- For a Cobb-Douglas production function like Y = AKᵅL^(1-α), the MPK equals αAKᵅ⁻¹L^(1-α), or in per-worker terms: MPK = αA(k)ᵅ⁻¹

## Importance in the Solow Model
- MPK determines the return on investment in the economy
- Due to diminishing returns to capital (when α < 1), MPK decreases as capital stock increases
- This explains why growth eventually slows as capital accumulates
- In competitive markets, MPK equals the real interest rate (r)

## Role in Determining Optimal Capital Stock
- In the Golden Rule, MPK = n+δ (population growth + depreciation)
- This condition identifies the capital level that maximizes steady-state consumption
- If MPK > n+δ, the economy has too little capital for consumption maximization
- If MPK < n+δ, the economy has excessive capital and is "dynamically inefficient"

## Practical Significance
- MPK helps explain why capital tends to flow from rich to poor countries (where MPK is higher)
- Declining MPK explains why investment becomes less productive as economies develop
- Differences in MPK across countries may signal barriers to efficient capital allocation
- Governments monitor implied MPK to assess investment efficiency

In summary, MPK is the additional output gained from an additional unit of capital, which tends to decline as capital accumulates due to diminishing returns. This concept is crucial for understanding investment returns, capital flows, and optimal saving rates in economic growth theory.
