# Analysis of Problem 3 Options

I'll analyze each option in Problem 3 where the saving rate s = 1/3 and capital per worker k = 1.

## Option A: "then output per worker y decreases over time."
- **Analysis**: This is FALSE. 
- **Reasoning**: When k = 1 and s = 1/3, we are exactly at the steady state (as shown in the solution where k* = 1). At the steady state, output per worker y = k^(2/3) = 1^(2/3) = 1 remains constant over time, not decreasing.
- **Economic intuition**: In the steady state, investment per worker exactly balances depreciation and the dilution effect of population growth, keeping capital per worker and output per worker constant.

## Option B: "then output Y increases over time at a constant rate."
- **Analysis**: This is TRUE.
- **Reasoning**: While output per worker (y) is constant at the steady state, aggregate output (Y) grows at the same rate as labor (n = 1/6). This happens because Y = L·y, where y is constant and L grows at rate n.
- **Economic intuition**: In the steady state, the economy grows in aggregate terms solely due to population growth, at rate n = 1/6.

## Option C: "then capital per worker k increases over time."
- **Analysis**: This is FALSE.
- **Reasoning**: Since k = 1 is exactly the steady-state value (k*), capital per worker remains constant over time. 
- **Economic intuition**: At the steady state, the saving rate generates just enough new capital to offset depreciation and the capital-dilution effect of population growth, keeping k constant.

## Option D: "then the capital stock K decreases over time at a constant rate."
- **Analysis**: This is FALSE.
- **Reasoning**: ==In the steady state, the aggregate capital stock K grows at the same rate as labor, which is n = 1/6. This is because K = L·k, where k is constant and L grows at rate n.==
- **Economic intuition**: While capital per worker remains constant, the total capital stock must grow to equip new workers entering the workforce, making K increase (not decrease) at rate n = 1/6.

Therefore, only option B is correct in this Solow growth model scenario.
# Solow Growth Model: Analysis of Variable Changes

Below is an analysis of when output per worker (y), capital per worker (k), aggregate output (Y), and aggregate capital (K) increase or decrease under different scenarios in the Solow growth model.

## Case 1: Below Steady State (k < k*)
When k < k* (capital per worker is below steady state):
- **k**: ↑ INCREASES (capital per worker grows)
- **y**: ↑ INCREASES (output per worker grows)
- **K**: ↑ INCREASES (at rate > n)
- **Y**: ↑ INCREASES (at rate > n)
- **Condition**: sf(k) > (n+δ)k (investment exceeds break-even investment)

## Case 2: At Steady State (k = k*)
When k = k* (capital per worker is at steady state):
- **k**: → CONSTANT
- **y**: → CONSTANT
- **K**: ↑ INCREASES (at rate = n)
- **Y**: ↑ INCREASES (at rate = n)
- **Condition**: sf(k) = (n+δ)k (investment equals break-even investment)

## Case 3: Above Steady State (k > k*)
When k > k* (capital per worker exceeds steady state):
- **k**: ↓ DECREASES
- **y**: ↓ DECREASES
- **K**: ↑ INCREASES (but at rate < n)
- **Y**: ↑ INCREASES (but at rate < n)
- **Condition**: sf(k) < (n+δ)k (investment is less than break-even investment)

## Special Cases

### Zero Population Growth (n = 0)
- **At steady state**: k and y are constant; K and Y are constant
- **Below steady state**: All variables increase
- **Above steady state**: All variables decrease

### Golden Rule Level
- Capital per worker (k) is at level that maximizes consumption per worker
- Occurs where MPK = n+δ

### Dynamic Inefficiency (k > kgolden)
- Excessive capital accumulation
- Economy could increase consumption both now and in future by reducing saving

This framework can help determine which of the options in Problem 3 are correct based on the specific conditions given.
