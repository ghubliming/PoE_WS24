# Understanding the Steady State Capital Equation

The equation $s \cdot f(k^*) = (\delta + n) \cdot k^*$ is fundamental in the Solow growth model, describing the steady state of capital per worker. Let me break down its meaning:

## Left Side: Investment
- $s$ is the savings rate (fraction of output saved)
-  $ s $是储蓄率（节省输出的一部分）
- $f(k^*)$ is the production function (output per worker)
- $s \cdot f(k^*)$ represents the ==investment== per worker

## Right Side: Capital Needs
- $\delta$ is the depreciation rate (how much existing capital wears out)
- $n$ is the growth rate of the labor force
- $k^*$ is the steady state ==capital per worker==
- $(\delta + n) \cdot k^*$ represents total capital needs per worker

## Deeper Meaning

The highlighted statement describes a fundamental balance in the steady state economy:

1. **Depreciation**: $\delta \cdot k^*$ is the amount of capital that wears out and must be replaced

2. **Capital Dilution**: $n \cdot k^*$ represents the new capital needed to equip new workers entering the labor force (to maintain the same capital-per-worker ratio)

3. **Economic Balance**: For the capital-labor ratio to remain constant (steady state), the investment must exactly offset both depreciation and the dilution effect from population growth

This equation explains why economies with high population growth rates need more investment just to maintain their capital per worker, and why high depreciation rates make it harder to accumulate capital.


**Savings rate (s)**: Fraction of total output that gets saved instead of consumed.

**Investment = sY** where:
- Y = total output of the economy
- s = savings rate
- So sY = total amount saved = total investment

**Per worker terms**:
- Y = total output = L × f(k) where L = number of workers
- Investment per worker = sY/L = s × f(k)

So s·f(k) is investment per worker because:
1. f(k) is output per worker
2. s is the fraction of that output saved
3. In equilibrium, savings = investment
4. Therefore s·f(k) = savings per worker = investment per worker

The key insight: when workers save a fraction s of their output f(k), that saved amount becomes investment in new capital.
