Let’s dive into this economics problem about general equilibrium in the IS-LM framework. The problem involves finding the interest rate in equilibrium as a function of taxes, government spending, and money supply, and then determining the change in money supply needed to offset the effect of a change in government spending on the equilibrium interest rate. I’ll break it down step by step, following the provided solution while explaining the reasoning, methods, concepts, assumptions, and definitions along the way.

### Understanding the Question

The problem is divided into two parts:

- **Part (a):** We need to find the interest rate $r^*$ in general equilibrium as a function of taxes $T$, government spending $G$, and money supply $M$. General equilibrium in the IS-LM model means both the goods market (IS curve) and the financial market (LM curve) are in equilibrium simultaneously.

- **Part (b):** Given $T = 100$, we need to calculate the change in money supply $M$ necessary to offset the effect of a marginal increase in government spending $G$ on the equilibrium interest rate $r^*$. In other words, we need to find $\frac{dM}{dG}$ such that $\frac{dr^*}{dG} = 0$, meaning the interest rate remains unchanged despite the change in $G$.

**Key Components:**
- **IS Curve (Goods Market):** Represents equilibrium where output $Y$ equals aggregate demand $Z$. It’s given by:
  $$
  Y = 200 + 0.75(Y - T) + 50 - 5r + G
$$
  After rearranging, it becomes:
  $$
  Y = 1,000 - 3T - 20r + 4G \quad (1)
$$
- **LM Curve (Financial Market):** Represents equilibrium where liquidity demand $L$ equals money supply $M$. It’s given by:
  $$
  Y - 80r = M
$$
  Rearranging yields:
  $$
  Y = M + 80r \quad (2)
$$
- **Interest Rate Function:** We need to solve for $r^*$ as a function of $T$, $G$, and $M$.
- **Offsetting Change:** For $T = 100$, find $\frac{dM}{dG}$ to keep $r^*$ constant when $G$ changes.

**Technical Terms and Definitions:**
- **IS Curve:** Derived from the goods market equilibrium where total output $Y$ equals aggregate demand, ==which includes consumption $C(Y - T)$, investment $I(r)$, and government spending $G$.==
- **LM Curve:** Derived from the money market equilibrium where ==money demand (a function of income $Y$ and interest rate $r$) equals money supply $M$.==
- **General Equilibrium:** The point where both IS and LM equations hold simultaneously, determining equilibrium $Y^*$ and $r^*$.

**Assumptions:**
- The consumption function is linear: $C(Y - T) = 200 + 0.75(Y - T)$, with a marginal propensity to consume (MPC) of 0.75.
- Investment is a linear function of the interest rate: $I(r) = 50 - 5r$.
- Money demand is linear: $L(Y, r) = Y - 80r$.
- The economy is closed (no exports or imports), as there’s no mention of net exports.
- All variables are in real terms, and there’s no inflation affecting the money market.

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Part (a): Find $r^*(T, G, M)$

The solution states: "Substituting equation (1) into equation (2) and solving yields the interest rate in general equilibrium as a function of taxes, government consumption, and money."

**Step 1: Set the IS and LM Equations Equal**
- **Explanation of Reasoning:** General equilibrium requires both the goods market (IS) and financial market (LM) to be in equilibrium simultaneously. Since both equations are solved for $Y$, we can set them equal to each other to eliminate $Y$ and solve for $r$.
- **Methods and Concepts:** This is a system of two equations with two unknowns ($Y$ and $r$). By equating the IS and LM equations, we reduce the system to one equation in terms of $r$, $T$, $G$, and $M$.
- **Assumptions:** The equations are correctly derived, and no other exogenous variables affect the equilibrium.

From the IS curve (1):
$$
Y = 1,000 - 3T - 20r + 4G
$$
From the LM curve (2):
$$
Y = M + 80r
$$
Set them equal:
$$
1,000 - 3T - 20r + 4G = M + 80r
$$

**Step 2: Solve for $r$**
- **Explanation of Reasoning:** We need to isolate $r$ to express it as a function of $T$, $G$, and $M$. This involves moving all terms involving $r$ to one side and the rest to the other.
- **Methods and Concepts:** Basic algebraic manipulation of linear equations.
- **Assumptions:** The coefficients are constant, and the relationship between variables is linear.

Rearrange the equation:
$$
1,000 - 3T - 20r + 4G - M - 80r = 0
$$
Combine the $r$-terms:
$$
1,000 - 3T + 4G - M - 20r - 80r = 0
$$
$$
1,000 - 3T + 4G - M - 100r = 0
$$
Isolate $r$:
$$
-100r = -(1,000 - 3T + 4G - M)
$$
$$
100r = 1,000 - 3T + 4G - M
$$
$$
r = \frac{1,000 - 3T + 4G - M}{100}
$$
Simplify:
$$
r = 10 - 0.03T + 0.04G - 0.01M \quad (3)
$$
This matches the given equation:
$$
r^*(T, G, M) = 10 - 0.03T + 0.04G - 0.01M
$$

**Verification:** Let’s ensure this makes economic sense. In the IS-LM model:
- Higher taxes $T$ reduce disposable income, lowering consumption and thus $Y$, which reduces money demand and lowers $r$ (coefficient $-0.03$).
- Higher government spending $G$ increases aggregate demand, raising $Y$, which increases money demand and thus $r$ (coefficient $+0.04$).
- Higher money supply $M$ increases liquidity, reducing $r$ (coefficient $-0.01$).

#### Part (b): Find $\frac{dM}{dG}$ to Keep $r^*$ Constant When $T = 100$

The solution states: "Substituting $T = 100$ into equation (3) yields $r^*(G, M) = 7 + 0.04G - 0.01M$. Total differentiation yields $\frac{dr^*}{dG} = 0.04 - 0.01 \frac{dM}{dG} = 0 \Rightarrow \frac{dM}{dG} = 4$."

**Step 3: Substitute $T = 100$ into $r^*$**
- **Explanation of Reasoning:** We need $r^*$ as a function of $G$ and $M$ to analyze how changes in $G$ and $M$ affect $r^*$. Substituting $T = 100$ simplifies the expression.
- **Methods and Concepts:** Substitution into a linear equation.
- **Assumptions:** $T$ is fixed at 100, and no other exogenous variables change.

$$
r^*(T, G, M) = 10 - 0.03T + 0.04G - 0.01M
$$
Substitute $T = 100$:
$$
r^* = 10 - 0.03(100) + 0.04G - 0.01M
$$
$$
r^* = 10 - 3 + 0.04G - 0.01M
$$
$$
r^*(G, M) = 7 + 0.04G - 0.01M
$$
This matches the given equation.

**Step 4: Total Differentiation to Find $\frac{dM}{dG}$**
- **Explanation of Reasoning==:** We want $r^*$ to remain constant ($\frac{dr^*}{dG} = 0$==) despite a change in $G$. Since $r^*$ depends on both $G$ and $M$, a change in $G$ must be offset by a change in $M$. Total differentiation accounts for the interdependence of $G$ and $M$.
- **Methods and Concepts:** Total differentiation of a function $r^*(G, M)$. For a function $r = f(G, M)$, the total differential is:
  $$
  dr = \frac{\partial r}{\partial G} dG + \frac{\partial r}{\partial M} dM
$$
  Since we want $dr^* = 0$:
  $$
  \frac{\partial r^*}{\partial G} dG + \frac{\partial r^*}{\partial M} dM = 0
$$
  Solve for $\frac{dM}{dG}$:
  $$
  \frac{dM}{dG} = -\frac{\frac{\partial r^*}{\partial G}}{\frac{\partial r^*}{\partial M}}
$$
- **Assumptions:** The relationship remains linear, and no other variables (like $T$) change.

From:
$$
r^* = 7 + 0.04G - 0.01M
$$
- Partial derivative with respect to $G$:
  $$
  \frac{\partial r^*}{\partial G} = 0.04
$$
- Partial derivative with respect to $M$:
  $$
  \frac{\partial r^*}{\partial M} = -0.01
$$
Set the total differential to zero:
$$
dr^* = \frac{\partial r^*}{\partial G} dG + \frac{\partial r^*}{\partial M} dM = 0
$$
$$
0.04 dG - 0.01 dM = 0
$$
Solve for $\frac{dM}{dG}$:
$$
0.01 dM = 0.04 dG
$$
$$
\frac{dM}{dG} = \frac{0.04}{0.01} = 4
$$
This matches the solution: $\frac{dM}{dG} = 4$.

**Economic Interpretation:** A marginal increase in $G$ raises aggregate demand, pushing up $Y$ and thus money demand, which increases $r^*$. To offset this, we increase $M$, which increases liquidity and lowers $r^*$. The ratio $\frac{dM}{dG} = 4$ means for every unit increase in $G$, $M$ must increase by 4 units to keep $r^*$ constant.

### Overall Summary

- **Part (a):** We derived the equilibrium interest rate by setting the IS and LM equations equal, solving for $r$:
  $$
  r^*(T, G, M) = 10 - 0.03T + 0.04G - 0.01M
$$
  This gives $r^*$ as a function of $T$, $G$, and $M$, consistent with the IS-LM framework where taxes reduce $r$, government spending increases $r$, and money supply decreases $r$.

- **Part (b):** With $T = 100$, we found $r^* = 7 + 0.04G - 0.01M$. To keep $r^*$ constant when $G$ changes, we used total differentiation, setting $\frac{dr^*}{dG} = 0$, and solved for $\frac{dM}{dG} = 4$. This means the money supply must increase by 4 units for every 1-unit increase in government spending to maintain the same interest rate.

The solution is complete and aligns with economic theory, confirming the final answer: $\frac{dM}{dG} = 4$.
