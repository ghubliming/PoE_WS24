In the IS-LM model (a macroeconomic framework), these letters represent:

- **I**: Investment - the spending by businesses on capital goods
- **S**: Savings - the portion of income not spent on consumption
- **L**: Liquidity preference (money demand) - how much money people want to hold
- **M**: Money supply - the total amount of money in circulation

The model uses two key curves:
1. **IS curve** (Investment-Savings): Shows combinations of interest rates and output where the goods market is in equilibrium
2. **LM curve** (Liquidity-Money): Shows combinations where the money market is in equilibrium

The problem also refers to:
- **T**: Taxes
- **G**: Government spending
- **C**: Consumption
- **Y**: Income/output
- **r**: Interest rate

The IS-LM model helps determine how policy changes (fiscal policies like G and T, or monetary policy like M) shift these curves and affect equilibrium values of output, interest rates, savings, and consumption.
