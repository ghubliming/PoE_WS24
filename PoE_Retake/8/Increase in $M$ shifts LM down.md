The LM curve represents equilibrium in the money market, showing combinations of interest rates (r) and output/income (Y) where money supply equals money demand. When the money supply increases, the LM curve shifts downward for the following reasons:

## Money Market Equilibrium
Money market equilibrium is given by: M/P = L(r,Y)
- M = money supply
- P = price level
- L = money demand (function of interest rate and income)

## When Money Supply (M) Increases:

1. **Initial Excess Supply**: At the original interest rate and income level, there's now an excess supply of money in the economy.

2. **Adjustment Process**: To restore equilibrium (for any given level of income):
   - Interest rates must fall to reduce the opportunity cost of holding money
   - Lower interest rates encourage people to hold more money and fewer bonds
   - This increases money demand until it equals the new, higher money supply

3. **Mathematical Result**: For any given Y, a lower interest rate r is now needed for equilibrium

Thus, the LM curve shifts downward, showing that at every level of income, the equilibrium interest rate is now lower than before the money supply increase.
##当货币供应（M）增加时：

1。**最初的过剩供应**：在原始利率和收入水平下，经济中的资金供应过多。

2。**调整过程**：恢复平衡（对于任何给定的收入水平）：
    - 利率必须下降以减少持有资金的机会成本
    - 较低的利率鼓励人们持有更多的钱和更少的债券
    - 这增加了金钱需求，直到它等于新的，更高的货币供应

3。**数学结果**：对于任何给定的y，现在需要较低的利率r才能平衡

因此，LM曲线向下移动，表明在每个收入水平上，均衡利率现在低于货币供应量增加之前。

# Mathematical Explanation: Why Money Supply Increases Shift the LM Curve Downward

## The LM Curve Equation

The money market equilibrium condition is:

$$\frac{M}{P} = L(r,Y)$$

Where the money demand function can be expressed as:

$$L(r,Y) = kY - hr$$

- $k$ = positive parameter for income sensitivity of money demand
- $h$ = positive parameter for interest rate sensitivity of money demand

## Deriving the LM Curve

Setting money supply equal to money demand:

$$\frac{M}{P} = kY - hr$$

Solving for the interest rate $r$:

$$hr = kY - \frac{M}{P}$$

$$r = \frac{k}{h}Y - \frac{1}{hP}M$$

This is the equation for the LM curve, showing $r$ as a function of $Y$.

## Effect of Increasing Money Supply

When money supply increases from $M$ to $M'$ (where $M' > M$):

**Original LM curve:**
$$r = \frac{k}{h}Y - \frac{1}{hP}M$$

**New LM curve:**
$$r' = \frac{k}{h}Y - \frac{1}{hP}M'$$

Since $M' > M$, we have:
$$\frac{1}{hP}M' > \frac{1}{hP}M$$

Therefore:
$$r' < r$$ for any given level of $Y$

This proves mathematically that the LM curve shifts downward when money supply increases.

## Numerical Example
If $k = 0.2$, $h = 0.5$, $P = 1$, and $M = 100$:
- Initial LM: $r = 0.4Y - 200$
- After increase to $M' = 150$: $r' = 0.4Y - 300$

At $Y = 1000$:
- Initial: $r = 0.4(1000) - 200 = 200$
- New: $r' = 0.4(1000) - 300 = 100$

The interest rate is lower at every level of income.
